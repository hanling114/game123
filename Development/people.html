The People
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some small notes on things I am writing for the game, shaped by some events when various people move in to your home. Some of this has been mentioned before so some of this is me thinking things through.

[b]Mother[/b]
a) your mother's given name is Alexandra, Alex for short (similar to her actual name Elexis)
b) she is bisexual, leaning more towards the lesbian end of the scale (her model seems to mainly do lesbian sets, but does do boy/girl sets just a lot less)
c) she likes Tess and welcomes her warmly to your home
e) she [b]really[/b] dislikes Anita, I will probably make it so Anita can only spend the night at your home, she will return to her lair in daytime (or the hotel)

In general she is jealous of any of the women in your life except Tracy and Tess, but hides it mostly

[b]Tess[/b]
tries to get along with everyone, but likes Anita the least. Gets on really well with Tracy

[b]Mrs Tanika[/b]
slave version: relates really well with Anita as a fellow slave sister
lover version: fine/indifferent to Anita
both: likes Tess and can be awkward around your mother but likes her. Indifferent to Tracy

[b]Anita[/b]
indifferent to most everyone, but respects your mother as a sort of proxy commander
hates Davy passionately as she considers he betrayed her
likes Bambi if you send her to guard Davy

[b]Tracy[/b]
easy going and willing to get along with anyone, but at least a little jealous of the others (all this references her after her being freed of Davy)
Friends with Leanne and Tina

Over on the volleyball court you a game has just finished and one of the players is a familiar looking girl, and for a moment you stop to admire her cute figure.

Her family recently moved to Glenvale but they has been estranged from your family for many years, some argument with your Mom many years ago. You know Mom visited a while ago so they have probably sorted that out. At the time you were too busy researching some occult works trying to locate references to the Book to go visit with Mom and Tracy.
If you had realised Cousin Kylie had grown up to be so cute, you would of definitely visited! You step over making a small wave of the hand and she calls out,
"Hi there, you're my cousin Bob aren't you? Nice to see you again after so many years! Do you play?", she says gesturing at the net.
Well you would certainly like to play, but maybe not the way she meant!

Introduction
You approach the house and again you cannot help but admire the fairly new and large house, It is a little bit of a contrast to some of the older homes in the area. You notice an expensive yellow sports car in the driveway.</p><p>You knock on the door, a little unclear on how you are going to approach Ellie but sure you can wing something. The door opens and you see a tall gorgeous blonde woman smiling at you. She speaks to you with a slight accent that you cannot quite place,
"Hello there I'm Carol Bartel, nice day! What is it you want? If you are for my wife Sally, she is away doing a business trip."
She has not invited you into the house yet so you are standing on the front door-step. As you consider your reply your eyes are almost unconsciously drawn to her large and you would guess natural breasts. You quickly look back up, and you see her smile, she must be very used to people admiring her.

Kate Granger
person "Kate"

Introduction
Everyone says that Kate is the school nerd. She joined Glenvale High two years ago and, for a while, every guy tried to hit on her.
Some rumors got around that she was available, and that jerk Davy Robbins claimed to have to have gotten
into her pants. That was before you knew her better and you cannot see how that could be true. Davy has always seemed to be a bit of a timid letch to you, then again he always got on well with Mr Beasley at school, as they say 'like is drawn to like'
Despite the rumours and what others think, she is okay if you speak to her the right way, a little aggressive, more likely to slap than yell. You have become friends with her, though you would like it to be more.

Personality Notes
- Aggressive, more likely to hit you than yell. Vengance is always carried out
- quick to judge and holds a grudge
(Hmm, why does the player like her?)
- Physical, likes martial arts
- Intellectial 'the school nerd'
- has a somewhat colourful sexual past before she moved to Glenvale, appears to have tried to put that aside once she moved here

Introduction

Davy has always seemed to be a bit of a timid letch to you, then again he always got on well with Mr Beasley at school, as they say 'like is drawn to like'
from Tina
"He has been obsessing over the warlock Kurndorf as of late. He was reading up a lot on the legendary book of spells the warlock was supposed to have, but he seemed to give up on that for now. He was researching the warlock himself, his life and death. One time he mentioned something called <b>Hellgate</b> and also a witch named <b>Jessica</b>. I have seen him meeting with his teacher Mr. Beasley often at the library I think they were working on this stuff together."
"All of this was aside from his usual obsession, our neighbour Kate Granger. Silly, he has no chance with her, she is athletic, smart and forthright, everything Davy is not!"

A servant who would be always well informed about you and your needs and ready to do any kind of chores you\'d give to her and would know you personally.

Maybe you can alter her attitude towards you and show her a new world…the world of servitude. She must also understand that the vase belongs to you. She will see that you did not commit any crime and you could always use a good lawyer. Who knows what mess will you get into next time?

Esmeralda, the Gypsy
person "Gypsy"

Introduction
The Fortune teller sits right in front of you as you look around her shop. Her mysterious appearance and her husky voice scares you a little. She seems to know you, you see it in her eyes that she is wondering about you. The place is all musky and you cannot really see much because of the dim light, but you recognise some of the items on the boards. Crystals, stones, magic powders, candles, crucifixes and all kind of occult things you could only think of! You even see a crytal ball, the one you saw in old horror movies where the witch used these balls to tell the future.
You cannot really decide if this woman is a hoax or a real fortune teller. However, a strong feeling comes over you; <i>don’t mess with her!</i>
The fortune teller starts to introduce herself to you.
"Welcome, Bob. I've been waiting for you!", her voice makes you tremble a bit. It seems otherwordly and distant.
"My name is Esmeralda and I'm going to help you find the answers you seek.", she continues, not lifting her heavy gaze from you.
"Don’t worry, I won’t hurt you, at least for now…I see you already have a question. Don't hesitate!", Esmeralda smiles vigorously.
You collect your thoughts and put away your waning fears and approach her.

Jesse
person "Jesse"

Introduction
One of the patrons, a girl with a bored expression and an innocent look about her, watches you enter. She looks kind of interested as you walk past.

You approach the girl, as you do she gestures to you to step out of the noisy bar and you leave with her to the nearby beer-garden.
"Hi there Bob," says the young girl. "My name is Jesse. This place is so boring. I wish that there was something exciting to do around here."
Now if this was your friend Catherine speaking you would of taken what she said as a proposition, but Jesse seems so innocent, it was more like an invitation to play a game. You ask her why she is here if it is so boring,
"I'm here in town with my father, while he is here on business. He thought I would enjoy it here while he is off in his meetings, there are a lot of stories about witches and ghosts around here and I love those spooky stories!"
You look at her innocent smile, and you suspect she may get more than 'spooked' here in town.

Mayor Beatrice Thomas/Bertie Thomas
person "Mayor Thomas"

Introduction
differs for murder/charmed path
Murder
You have heard a lot about Beatrice Thomas, the mayor of the town, but this is the first time you have seen her in flesh, but you know your mother has regularly worked out at the gym with her. She used to be a lawyer before she ran for the mayors office. Some people say she cheated on her campaign by using a large sum of money from an unknown helperMayor. She used the money to repair the hospital and improve the health-care, but also to reinforce herself as the perfect candidate for the job.
She’s only been mayor for 3 months, but the townsfolk already gossip about her being rude and cold to her workers and neglecting her work.
As you stand in her well decorated office, you feel that something is not right. She looks gorgeous, but her grim face tells you that she doesn’t like visitors. Especially the likes of you.
Charmed
You know that Beatrice Thomas, the current mayor was a lawyer before she made it into politics. She used to visit the local gym where your Mom worked out too so you've seen her sometimes. She always looked so organized and well dressed, but she did not speak much and had that distant attitude.
She has been the mayor for 3 months now, but her reputation as a lady with iron will had not changed much. She gets and does what she wants, and nobody would dare talk back to her.
As you stand in her well decorated office, her cool eyes watching you, you feel little around her. She lazily juggling a pencil between her hands and doesn’t seem to be happy that you disturbed her work.

"Mrs Granger is in a very dangerous condition. I'm sorry, but you are going to have to leave unless you are a relative of hers."
There is no way you can claim to be a relative, after all you called her Mrs. Granger. While thinking you look at the nurse appreciately, you have to admire the choice of uniforms in this hospital. As you do the nurse looks at you knowingly,

"Hello, my name is Monique," says the girl. "How may I help you?"
You apologise if you startled her, and she smiles,
"Sorry I was just reading a little on this town's history and Tess had recently told me some creepy stories about magic and I was a little...umm...on edge. She likes to tease me about things I am a little afraid of, things I am interested in but..well..anxious about."

Mr Beasley
person "MrBeasley"

Introduction
Your least favourite teacher, Mr Beasley. It is not that he is nasty or harsh, you just cannot but help to feel he is a bit slimy, a creep.
While there is nothing you can pin down, aside from his occasional leers at female students, and you have heard he has been reprimanded by the principal for it. It is probably more that he is so assured that he is superior to everybody, descended from the aristocracy and financially well-off.
Yet, with all that, he is brilliant, an expert on science and oddly also matters of the occult, especially where it involves the history of Glenvale. As long as you deal with him carefully and tolerate his ways, then he could be a valuable ally.

Ms. Jones
person "MsJones"

Introduction
Ms. Jones has an office in one of the older parts of the school, and when you enter the room you see Ms. Jones sitting on her desk. It is strange how often you see Ms. Jones doing something...eccentric. It is not that she is a playful free-spirit, just that she is a little odd. Odd, but very sensual who borderline flirts with her students to get them to pay attention and work harder. Well something is certainly harder for her.
The other distinct thing about her is her French accent, some would say outrageous and over the top, others cute and sensual. One time your friend Amy mentioned she had gone on a holiday to France with her family, and people there did not speak how Ms. Jones does. Then again there are many regional dialects and accents in France from what you have looked up.
You wonder how easily you could learn French if she would be devouted to you. She could even give you private lessons and could tutor you. If her over attached and too playful character would not drive you mad of course because she can be a little bit annoying at times. It depends solely on what you want to do with her.

Officer, Chief Kerry Batton
person "Officer Batton"

Introduction
Officer Batton is the kind of woman who you don’t want to mess with. She’s the head of the police department in this town. That means she knows every legal and illegal activities that happens here. She could be a serious opposition if she learns about your powers  and you have read in a newspaper article that she was a SWAT member before accepting this job; so she would easily kick your butt in a fight.
However; you can’t get your mind off her. Imagine if the officer in charge of this town would be yours to command. You could use all the manpower, weapons and vehicles of the police force againts your battle with Kurndorf , Davy or anyone else who stands in your way. Committing crimes without punsihments and partying all the time without having to worry about the law is just a bonus.
As you watch her fit physique in that uniform standing in front of you and thinking about your options makes you horny. Suddenly her gaze meets with yours. She stands up from her chair and comes to you.
"Hey there! Do you have something to tell me or report?"
she asks warmly. You nervously hesitate to answer, but her friendly face and words relaxes you a bit.
"If there’s nothing you want to say or report that’s fine, you can hang around if you want, but please don’t disturb my partners and don’t touch anything!"
with a gentle smile she pats your shoulder and turns around going back to her office.
Whoa. You never thought she’s that kind. You realize now; she could be easily persuaded to join your ranks.

Officer Khan
person "Officer Khan"

Introduction
Differs a bit for Murder/Charmed but basically similar
You recognise Ms Khan is the officer standing in front of you. She used to live next door to your house. Your mother talked to her a lot back in the day and sometimes Ms Khan even visited your house for dinner.
From these visits you learned that she did not want to be an officer first, she was more interested in becoming a soldier. However, her dominant nature and harsh attitude made her realize that by becoming a police officer she could exercise her power over the people quicker and easier. So, yeah, your first impressions of her were not so good...she’s and uptight and arrogant bitch who’s hunger for power could only be matched by her heavenly body and appearance and it looks like she hasn’t changed a bit.
She worked her way through the ladder and is now the right hand woman to Police Chief Batton.
She comes to you and shakes your hand, introducing herself in the process. She doesn’t seem to recognise you. What a surprise!

Officer Becky Smith
person "Officer Smith"

Introduction
Officer Becky Smith is the youngest officer in the police department. She's a cadet and just recently finished her studies at the police academy.
You know her from school, she was a senior year student when you just started your first year. You barely spoke to each other and you don’t think she would recognize you now, but you used to hang out once or twice when there was a big event in the school.
She was quite sure that she wanted to be an officer of the law back then already. She was really ambitious and was passionately interested in making the world a better, safer place. Maybe that comes from her father who’s a navy veteran.
It looks like she's the jail guard here. They usually give the most boring jobs to the young cadets just so they can learn the ropes. She looks strict and serious patrolling between the jail cells every ten minutes.
