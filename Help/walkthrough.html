		<h2 onclick="hide('foreword')">Foreword</h2>
		<div id="foreword" class="spoiler">
			<p>This the official walkthrough as updated by Capacitor and was heavily influenced by the three old walkthroughs. Many parts, especially in the first chapters, are simply a copy of these, with some rearrangements in order to avoiding too much branching.</p>
			<p>Although it should bring you through every minor and major event in the game, I can't guarantee this walkthrough is 100% complete. I may have missed a few minor scenes and some dialogues here and there, and probably some events that seemed straightforward to me have some hidden condition I didn't notice and thus didn't write in the walkthrough. And there is always the possibility that some of the indications given are inaccurate, either because the game changed since when the first walkthrough was written, or because I misinterpreted some parts.</p>
			<p>Remember also that the purpose of the game is to have fun. This walkthrough will guide you through all the events, but won't show you every scene with every character, because most of them have no consequence on the story. It's up to you not to neglect your slaves' sexual needs.</p>
			<p>There are also many hidden Stones and Books in town, including all of them in here is almost impossible. Wander around, explore every house and every corner, use the Clairvoyance and Pass spells. You may find many useful things that are not written here.</p>
			<p>Have fun!</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2 onclick="hide('intro')">General Tips</h2>
		<div id="intro" class="spoiler" style="display:none;">
			<ul>
				<li>In general wander around and talk to anyone who will speak to you.</li>
				<li>Some events are timed, as in they will appear, a phone will ring, a knock on the door, and you have a certain number of actions to respond. This varies from one to ten actions.</li>
				<li>Some events are timed based on the number of times you visit key locations, these are commonly <span class="bold">The Wild Ranges</span>, <span class="bold">Your Bedroom</span>, <span class="bold">The Library</span> and a follow-up event will happen after a few visits to these key locations.</li>
				<li>You can leave <span class="bold">any</span> item in your own bedroom.</li>
				<li>The game will give you items like Old Stones at times but generally only if you do not have one in your inventory. It is best to use Stones when they are found by visiting the Wild Ranges.</li>
				<li>The exact order of some events are not required, you can charm one person then another or do the second one first, but there may be an optimal order to see all possible content in the game.</li>
				<li>The game saves automatically every morning and evening, but it's better to save regularly too.</li>
				<li>Check the notes in your phone, it will remind you of things you have been asked to do.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Game Settings</h3>
			<p>The settings can be changed from your phone. Most of them can be found under the &quot;App&quot; icon:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Alarm:</span> Choose when you want to wake up after a night of sleep.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Alert New SMS's:</span> The game shows or hides SMS alerts.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Explicit Filter:</span> The game shows or hides sexually explicit images. This can also be set at the beginning of the game.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Theme:</span> Switch between white and black themes.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Inventory:</span> The items in the inventory can have icons shown for the actions you can select, or text labels.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Inventory:</span> The inventory can be shown in the right bar, or as a popup called from the left bar.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Spell Runes:</span> You can change from the &quot;Rune Matching&quot; system for learning spells to the older version of looking up text (spell names) in the Book. This can also be set at the beginning of the game.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Undo:</span> Enable or disable rollback on some game-ending actions. This can also be set at the beginning of the game.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Bubbles:</span> The pop-up bubbles many conversation responses appear in are by default centered in the window. They can also be positioned at the lower left of the screen.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Memory:</span> Changes the limit on number of save games and photos in your phone</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Speaker:</span> Enabled or disables most sound effects in the game.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Columns:</span> Alters the layout of the center space on the screen. Using 2 columns allow text and buttons to wrap better but some players dislike the button alignment at times.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The remaining settings can be found under the &quot;Play a game&quot; icon:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Cheat Helper:</span> Enables or disables cheats</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Puzzles Helper:</span> You can enable or disable puzzles. In the walkthrough the answers to the puzzles are given. Each has a variation and each is given. If you disabled them then you automatically get the puzzle correct. This can also be set at the beginning of the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can also minimize the left and right bars to show a minimal set of icons. Some of the icons will show useful information if you hover your mouse over them.</p>
			<p>Note on an Android device you can swipe left or right to open/close the side bars.</p>
			
			<h3>Cheating</h3>
			<p>The game has a built-in cheat mode that is enabled by the 'Cheat Helper' app in the Games menu in your phone. This enables the cheat menu which is accessible in the Left Bar of the game, at the left of the game window, clicking the app automatically opens the left bar.</p>
			<p>You can cheat to add money or mana and this is completely safe and will not affect the story and event progression. You can also add experience to learn trainings but it is recommended you do not do this until later in the game.</p>
			<p>Otherwise in the menu:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">View People:</span> Allows you to edit details for yourself or other people in the game. Includes add/remove items from a person.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">View Items:</span> Allows you to add or move items in the game that are not in someones possession.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">View Places:</span> Allows you change flags for a place. Flag 1 indicates a place is known and visitable.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Wait x:</span> Allows time to pass, up to 1 day, or even go backward in time.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Taxi's:</span> By default taxi cabs are available some of the time. Click the link to make them always available, click again to return to sometimes.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Explicit:</span> You can toggle on/on Explicit images.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Locale:</span> You can swap between US and UK setting.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Mod:</span> You can toggle the mods available in the game, recommend do not use this!.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Details on flags and other technical details are documented in the files in the folder &quot;Development&quot;.</p>
			
			<h3>Gender Differences</h3>
			<p>Male and female players do affect a number of events, notably how you learn the <span class="italic">Possession</span> spell.<br/>
			One item, a strap-on, is unique to female characters and is only present in the Explicit version of the game.</p>
			<p>It is possible using the <span class="italic">Transform</span> spell (see below) for a female player to become a hermaphrodite/futanari, a woman with a cock as well as a pussy, or repeat to a female. Similarly a male can become female then futa. In most situations the game will treat a futa as a male for sex scenes except you will still be referred to using female pronouns like she/her etc.</p>
			
			<h3>Paths</h3>
			<p>These are major ways to play the game that considerably vary events in the game. There are three currently, some with variants.</p>
			<h3>Apprentice Path</h3>
			<p>In this path you become Sir Ronald Gates' apprentice. In this path <span class="bold">no killing</span> will take place, outside of a few bad endings.</p>
			<h3>Conspiracy Path</h3>
			<p>In this path you refuse Sir Ronald Gates' apprenticeship. Parts of the game are significantly reorganized, notably for money and the <span class="italic">Clairvoyance</span> spell. In this path <span class="bold">no killing</span> will take place, outside of a few bad endings.</p>
			<h3>Murder Path</h3>
			<p>In this path Sir Roland Gates is killed and you are the prime suspect and can be the actual killer. In this path <span class="bold">people can be killed</span>, either by accident or design.</p>
			<h4>Hard Murder Path</h4>
			<p>You demand Sir Ronald give you the Book, and argue over the book with Sir Roland and kill him by accident.</p>
			<h4>Soft Murder Path</h4>
			<p>You demand the Book but leave before killing Sir Ronald, but then witness another person killing him but you will be considered the murderer.<br/>
			Death can still take place in this path, you are just not personally responsible for Sir Ronald's death. Maybe others, just not his.</p>
			
			<h3>Story Arcs</h3>
			<p>There are major quests/story arcs in the game and common to all paths. These are semi independent, except some require the completion of others.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Seance:</span> To try to summon the ghost of Kurndorf and learn his secrets.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">The Ritual:</span> The aftermath of the Seance and trying to banish or bind his ghost.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">The Demon:</span> A demon unleashed in the Seance is stalking you.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Dragon Gem:</span> Quest for a hidden spell and to get an item of magic power.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Davy and Kate:</span> Davy is obsessed with Kate and it can be a key to controlling him.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Vampyre:</span> There is a Vampyre in Glenvale, stalking the Gates family.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">A Witch Freed:</span> Jessica can be freed after the Seance, though many people just keep her as a slave, but she can be freed as a useful ally. To free here is deliberately difficult.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Ross Sisters:</span> To control the three Ross sisters.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Dream Succubus:</span> A demon appears in a vision and then a dream, can you control her? Well yes, but it is not like the others, there is a price.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These two arcs are interdependent and require <span class="bold">Dragon Gem</span> and <span class="bold">The Demon</span> to be completed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Free Leanne:</span> The Demon takes your friend Leanne as a soulless Thrall. Can you save her?</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Corrupting Mother Superior:</span> The Church's Mother Superior is very strong willed, can you take her as a slave?</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Day and Night</h3>
			<p>Time passes in the game at the rate of 10 minutes per action outside and 5 minutes inside. Some actions take no time like checking items or your phone. Options to relax for a while take 1 hour or 30 minutes, depending on the location you are in.</p>
			<p>Most shops open at 8AM and close at 6PM, but some places differ to this like the School and Restaurant.<br/>
			Some events are unique to day time or night time.</p>
			<p>Additionally there are days of the week, with the game starting on a Monday. Some places are not open on weekends, for instance the Town Hall and the Bank. Some events only happen on certain days of the week, the game does tell you these criteria and can be noted in your phone in the calendar.</p>
			<p>You can spend the night in your bedroom, waking at 6AM. You can change your alarm setting in your phone to 6AM, 7AM or 8AM, using the Alarm App. Some friendly (read &quot;charmed&quot;) people will allow you to spend the night at their home too.</p>
			<p>Some things you may wish to save for night time, like using Stones or having sex <span class="bold">again</span> with charmed people. At night the spell <span class="italic">Pass</span> can be your friend and allow entry to some places otherwise locked.</p>
			<p>The following guides do not note spending the night and some of the steps listed below can vary where you leave some for the night time.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2 onclick="hide('magic')">Magic Tips</h2>
		<div id="magic" class="spoiler" style="display: none;">
			<h3>Spells</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Charm (Dai Chu):</span> Increases another's desire and friendliness towards you, but only if the victim is not under the influence of someone else. A person's name is important in all forms of magic targeting a person and is a key part of casting this spell. This is a forbidden spell. Costs 10 mana.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Clairvoyance (Tuo Duo):</span> Allows you to detect things that are normally hidden or even invisible. If used on water, it shows visions of the future IF you learn about Hydromancy from the History Classroom. Costs 3 mana.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Invisibility (Dest):</span> Invoking its power cloaks the user from sight - but <span class="italic">only</span> sight - so one must be careful to not call too much attention to oneself while no longer visible to the naked eye. Costs 5 mana.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Pass (Serphoni):</span> Lets you pass through doors and other entryways. Costs 2 mana.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Possession (Unstr Hun):</span> Transports a spirit into another body, but only for a brief period of time. Costs 20 mana.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Shielded Charm (Neo One):</span> Your knowledge of the shielded charm allows you to cast this spell when in public. Costs 10 mana.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Teleport (Shio Stin Mur):</span> Transports you anywhere you know about but there are some limitations where you can actually teleport to. Costs 1 mana.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Transform (Al Mass):</span> A spell of physical transformation. Costs 20 mana.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Unlife Enspelled (Mir Daru):</span> It will bind the undead to the caster, making them the casters thrall. Unlike the charm spell the being's name is not essential to the success of this spell. If you do know it then the effect is significantly more powerful. Costs 10 mana.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Wealth (Dert Pher):</span> Materializes money from magic. Costs 1 mana and produces 10$.</li>
				<!--<li><span class="bold">??? (Ert Nau):</span> ???</li>-->
				<!--<li><span class="bold">??? (Vil Ras):</span> ???</li>-->
			</ul>
			<p>Other spells are in the Book but cannot be learned at this time</p>
			
			<h4>Transform Spell</h4>
			<p>Currently the <span class="italic">Transform</span> spell will only affect some characters and they must be first charmed (except Davy):</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Yourself:</span> Gender change, Breast enlargement or cock growth (Hidden Room, see below).</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Abby:</span> Body change between models.</li>				
				<li><span class="bold">Angela:</span> Breast enlargement (Town Hall).</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Bambi:</span> Breast enlargement (Hotel), or her body (to change to a different model).</li>				
				<li><span class="bold">Beasley, Mr:</span> Gender change, two teen or two versions of bimbo (Beasley's Office).</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Charlie:</span> Gender change (Gym). Repeatable.</li>				
				<li><span class="bold">Davy Robbins:</span> Gender change (Hotel Cellar).</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Donna:</span> Body change between models.</li>	
				<li><span class="bold">Geraldine, Mrs Robbins:</span> Body change between models.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Gina:</span> Body change between models.</li>		
				<li><span class="bold">Granger, Mrs:</span> Rejuvenation to a look a bit younger and recast to reverse</li>				
				<li><span class="bold">Jade:</span> Body change between models.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">John Adams:</span> Gender change, teen or three variations of MILF (Adams' House). You can change between these genders by recasting the spell.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Jenny:</span> Cock growth (Restaurant), or her body (to change to a different model).</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Louise:</span> Breast enlargement or cock growth (General Shop), or her body (to change to a different model).</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Madison:</span> Breast enlargement (TV Station), or her body (to change to a different model).</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Mayor Thomas:</span> Gender change.</li>				
				<li><span class="bold">Miku:</span> Cat-girl familiar (Attic).</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Mom:</span> Rejuvenation to a look a bit younger and recast to reverse, or her body (to change to a different model)</li>				
				<li><span class="bold">Mother Superior:</span> Breast enlargement or cock growth (Church).</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Nina:</span> Body change between models.</li>				
				<li><span class="bold">Nurse Megan:</span> Body change between models.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Nurse Sandra:</span> Body change between models.</li>	
				<li><span class="bold">Officer Smith:</span> Body change between models.</li>				
				<li><span class="bold">Pamela:</span> Body change between models.</li>				
				<li><span class="bold">Tanika, Mrs:</span> Body change between models.</li>				
				<li><span class="bold">Titus, Ms:</span> Rejuvenation to a look a bit younger and recast to reverse.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Tracy:</span> Body change between models.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Zoey:</span> Breast enlargement (TV Station), or her body (to change to a different model).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You'll be able to transform people after defeating Kurndorf and obtaining the soul bound crystal. Transformations can be irreversible but this varies from person to person. For all people except yourself and Davy Robbins you must first cast Charm on the person before being able to transform them.</p>
			<p>In general before you learn the training "Molding as Desired" transformations are one-way, but after you can undo or reverse them.</p>
			<p>To cast the spell on yourself you need to learn of the Mirrors of the Soul in the Hidden Room, and then cast the spell there. The Vampyre or Ms. Jones will give this information.</p>
			<h4>Hydromancy</h4>
			<p>This is a variant of the Clairvoyance spell and you can learn it in the History Class. You will need to also be trained in Mediation, check the Yoga studio and Cherry. It can be used at the Park Duck Pond and at Ms Titus' home, when she is not there. It can give hints on the plot at key times, notably for the Mom &amp; Gabby &quot;run away&quot; bad end, but also for the old key and wine bottle stories and for Elian.</p>
			<p>A word of warning about this last topic. The first time you try to use Hydromancy after the Seance, you'll have visions of a demon. The night after you'll dream the same demon, that will give you directions on how to reach her: from the Sacred Clearing teleport to Elian (visible in the left column) at night. Talk to Jade before trying.</p>
			<h3>Trainings</h3>
			<p>As your character gets more experienced you can learn improvements to your magical skills/spells. These are learned based on a point system.</p>
			<p>You earn 3 experience points per spell learned and 1 point for every person/being charmed. You start with 1 point once you pick up the book, and Tess's research and the Gold Worm give a small amount. Once you learn of the &quot;Mirror of Souls&quot; you can look in it and see the current total of experience and total of experience spent so far.</p>
			<p>Every 9 points you get the option to learn a training and the Book will start blinking in your inventory. <span class="bold">Examine it</span>. You can then consult with either Sir Ronald or Tess Adams to learn a new ability. On the Conspiracy Path Sarah can also teach you. You only need to examine the book once, the book will blink each time you get enough points. One hypnotic ability (key to Mother Superior) is learned separately from Mr. Beasley; you still need the points to learn it. Another ability, &quot;defending yourself with magic&quot;, is learned from Alison once you charm her.</p>
			<p>The trainings are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Manipulative charms:</span> Add variations to the charm process for selected people. You can change the outcome at any moment in the game for 5 mana.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Defending yourself with magic:</span> Protection from other magical attacks if you have 20+ mana. (<span class="bold">only learned after charming Alison</span>)</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Masculine cantrips:</span> Ability to charm men.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Medium powers:</span> Ability to charm ghosts.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Molding as desired:</span> Addiotinal options for the transform spell.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Precision transitions:</span> Can teleport with people and can inscribe your own hexagrams.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Moulding as Desired</span> More options for the transform spell, including reversing transformations.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Conserving magic:</span> Spells cost 10% less mana, rounded up.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Harnessing mana:</span> You get 20% more mana from Stones.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Golden gestures:</span> You get 50% more money from the <span class="italic">Wealth</span> spell.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Unseen:</span> Invisibility lasts longer.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Firmer Possessions</span> Possession spell does not end when you pass though a doorway. Only when you will it or at dawn or dusk.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Augmented hypnosis:</span> Instant hypnotic induction. (<span class="bold">only learned from Mr. Beasley</span>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p><span class="bold">NOTE:</span> <span class="bold">Masculine charms</span>, <span class="bold">Defending yourself with magic</span>, <span class="bold">Precision transitions</span>, <span class="bold">Augmented hypnosis</span> and <span class="bold">Medium powers</span> are necessary in order to progress the story. Learn them, in this order or with some minor variations, as soon as you can. The walkthrough will tell you when to learn which training in order to progress with the story. The other trainigs can be useful, but are not strictly necessary in order to progress with the story.</p>

		<div id="index" class="spoiler" style="display: none;">
			<p>In the following table you can find in which chapter is described how to meet and charm every character. In the last column is also indicated how many variants exist to the charming process. Variants in italic require the Manipulative Charms training, while letters A (Aprentice), C (Conspiray) and M (Murder) indicate that the variant is available only on the corresponding path and variants in brackets are available only after the character is charmed.</p>
			<p>Variants other than slave generally require you know the Manipulative Charms training.</p>

			<div class="path path-conspiracy">
				<p>Leave the Mansion, catch the taxi and return to your Home on Kollam St.</p>
				<p>Enter your Home, and a delivery girl will give you a package containing the Book and a little money. Pick up the Book, examine it and open it.<br/>
				Leave your home and check the SMS message. It is no longer needed, delete it if you want (or keep for reference).</p>
				<p>Go to the Shopping Center. Visit the Antiques shop and talk to Victoria (all options).</p>
				<p>Go to the School and meet your friend Catherine.<br/>
				Talk to Beasley, tell him you have the Book, but <span class="bold">do not</span> give it to him. If you do, it's game over.</p>

				<p>Leave the Mansion and take the waiting taxi back to the School.</p>
				<p>Go to the School and talk to Beasley, tell him you have the Book, but <span class="bold">do not</span> give it to him. If you do, it's game over.<br/>
				Ask Mr. Beasley what mana does, then ask where to find Magic Stones.<br/>
				Exit the room and meet your friend Catherine.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Exit the building, walk to the Park and look for Kate. She can be either in the <b>Park Pathway</b> or on the <b>Park Bridge</b>. Approach her, and the following event is otherwise identical whereever you find her.<br/>
			You have three choices: you can either go away, <b>ask why she's in a hurry</b> or insult her. The second one (in bold) is the only that will let you have her as your willing girlfriend in the future (but you will still be able to charm her), the other two will lock out all future events for her, except charming her.<br/>
			If you ignored or insulted her, pick up her address.</p>
			<p>If at the bridge go to the Park Pathway. Take the kite from the tree and pick up the string.<br/>
			Enter the Wild Ranges and get an Old Stone, but don't use it yet. You should also meet Adele Ross briefly.<br/>
			Explore the stones and talk to Seraphina when she says &quot;Hello&quot;. It's not possible to charm her here, so there is no need to try and delay the encounter until you kmow the spell.<br/>
			You may also randomly find a group of campers here, but they can't be charmed as of version 14.14.</p>
			<p>If you agreed to study with Kate in the Library, now is the time. Go to the Library and study with Kate. If you have puzzles enabled, the answers to the minigame are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Square</span> hint: <span class="hidden">first divided by two plus second doubled</span> solution: <span class="hidden">70</span></li>
				<li><span class="bold">Circles</span> hint: <span class="hidden">left number &times; 5 = other two added</span> solution: <span class="hidden">24</span></li>
				<li><span class="bold">Triangles</span> hint: <span class="hidden">product of two largest minus square of smallest</span> solution: <span class="hidden">29</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>To get the girlfriend (best) ending with Kate make sure to <span class="bold">stare at her breasts</span> or <span class="bold">touch her ass</span>. These are the same, they just differ in flavour and images.<br/>
			Pick up her address before leaving the study area.</p>
			<p>Go home in Kollam Street, a delivery girl should be there with a package for Mom. This is just introducing Zoey and may occur another time depending on the time of day.<br/>
				Answer the telephone for a radio quiz. The answers are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Animals</span> - <span class="hidden">llama</span></li>
				<li><span class="bold">Maths</span> - <span class="hidden">. (as in a decimal point)</span></li>
				<li><span class="bold">Fishing</span> - <span class="hidden">3</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is no reason to fail this aside from seeing some minorly different events, it will delay getting the magnet for a while. The girl who delivers the prize can still be found at the TV Station later with different scenes.</p>
			<p>Leave your home and walk down the alley to Yoolaroo Dr. and visit the Granger house. You will briefly see a person in the street (Tina Robbins)<br/>
			Talk to Mrs. Granger and tell her she's pretty. There are three mutually exclusive alternatives, the first one is preferable (asking for a beer has no consequences):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ask Mrs. Granger if she works out and if she finds anything. Get an Old Stone.</li>
				<li>Ask Mrs. Granger if she needs help and do the puzzle, the answer is <span class="hidden">7</span> and is worth 5$. Then tell her she's sexy for an extra 5$.</li>
				<li>Ask Mrs. Granger if you can do anything for her and do the puzzle, the answer is <span class="hidden">3</span> and is worth 5$. Then tell her she has no panties for an extra 5$.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Ask Mrs. Granger if Kate is home. If you helped her, she is in her room.<br/>
			Chat with her, compliment her figure and ask about the  photo. Now bet her about Bruce Lee. The answer is <span class="hidden">Game of Death</span>. Note: getting it wrong has some nice images too <b>but</b> locks you out of 'girlfriend' Kate ending.<br/>
			If you instead try to kiss her, you'll miss the scene and be locked out of 'girlfriend' Kate ending.</p>

				<p>Go to the Shopping Center and enter the Bank. Speak with Ellie the bank teller and start an account.<br/>
				Give Ellie the Letter of Credit and visit the Manager Kristin to be advanced 100$.<br/>
				Make sure to deposit enough money at the ATM so that you have less than 30$ with you.</p>
				<p>Find a taxi, go to see Sir Ronald and give him a Stone, remember you have to use the <b>give</b> option in your inventory for one of the Old Stones you have.<br/>

			<p>Visit again the Library and ask Ms. Titus about the book she was reading.<br/>
			Next visit the Reference Area and ask Monique to look up more information on Kurndorf.<br/>

			<p>Go to the School, then in the Park and the Wild Ranges and <span class="bold">use</span> your Stone(s). <span class="bold">You must return here to use any Stones you find later in the game.</span><br/>
			A ghost will appear. If you found more than one Stone, use them all, then follow the ghost to the School, Kollam Street and the Alley. Watch the ghost walk through the wall.</p>
			<p>Cast Pass to enter the Hidden Room, examine the note and learn <span class="italic">Dai Chu</span>, the Charm spell.<br/>
			Note: Kate leaves her home and Mr. Beasley his classroom now.<br/>
			Leave the Hidden Room.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice">
				<p>Return to the Mansion and Sir Ronald (remember to have under $30 and no letter of credit on you to get a new letter of credit)<br/>
				Tell him or not about the <b>forbidden</b> charm spell. Currently this is just for flavour but in later versions this will select a new path.<br/>
				<b>Note:</b> if it is night time it is best to leave this trip until the following day.</p>

		<h2 onclick="hide('ch2')">Chapter 2: Charm As If There's No Tomorrow</h2>
		<div id="ch2" class="spoiler" style="display: none;">
			<p>Now it's time to explore the city and charm every woman (un)lucky enough to remain alone with you. There are two important things to remember. First of all, you will need <span class="bold">a lot</span> of mana. You can occasionally find a few Magic Stones in specific places, but to really charm every woman in the game you will need some serious grinding. Here are a few options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can find a paperweight for 3$ in the general store. You can free the Stone inside at the Wild Ranges. You can only have one paperweight at a time.</li>
				<li>You can buy Rustic Stones at the New Age Store for 100$ if you have less than 20 mana. Knowing the Wealth spell and having the Golden Gestures and/or Harnessing Mana trainings is a good but slow strategy to have infinte amounts of mana.</li>
				<li>Once you learn the Clairvoyance spell and the Medium Powers training you can visit the Sacred Clearing at night and charm a ghost after casting Clairvoyance. You get back more mana than this costs, but can be done only once per night.</li>
				<li>Once you charm Keana's Ghost you can have sex with her once per night and get some mana at no cost.</li>
				<li class="path path-murder">Once you obtain the Wooden Box, you can go to the Sacred Clearing, open it and take a pebble. It will transform into a Rustic Stone. Then go to the Wild Ranges and use it. This is the quickest way to grind mana, but will be available only later in the game.</li>
				<li>If you want to speed up the process, you can cheat and give yourself enough mana to go through the entire game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The second thing you should remember is that you will soon be able to train, if you aren't already. As soon as you see your book glowing, examine it. For more information on the topic, see the Magic Tips above.</p>
			<h3>Meet your Family</h3>
			<p>Return home and go to the kitchen during the day or in the living room at night and ask Tracy where Davy is, then ask what is going on.<br/>
			Visit Mom in her room and ask all options.<br/>
			You can't charm either your sister nor your mother yet, but if you try to charm Tracy you get an insightful message.</p>
			<p>Go to your bedroom. Drop the Book to obtain an Old Stone, then pick both of them up.<br/>
			Go to bed for the night and deny Tracy's request. Agreeing leads to a bad end, so if you want to see it remember to save before going to sleep.<br/>
			Go to the kitchen and listen to Tracy's conversation, answer questions as you like.</p>
			<p>Most likely there will also be a knock at your door from Madison below. If you see both options for the knock and to listen to Tracy, first listen to Tracy's call. After the call you can still answer the door.</p>
			<h3 id="madison">Charm Madison</h3>
			<p>Return home if not already there. If you answered the radio quiz correcty and it's still day or evening, there should be a knock at the front door, answer the door and meet Madison. Otherwise you will meet her in the morning after a good night of sleep, possibly related to Tracy's request to sleep with you above..<br/>
			Ask her to bring the stereo inside, then pick up the Magnet and cast the charm spell via your inventory or using the quick icons in the right bar. Every choice otherwise results in Madison leaving your house. This is a one-time event, but you can still charm her later at the TV Station.</p>
			<div class="gender gender-female">
				<p>If you tell Madison you would like to fuck her during the charming process, you get a Strap-On. (Explicit Content must be enabled)</p>
			</div>
			<p>If you decide instead to ignore the door, or didn't answer correctly on the phone, you will find the Magnet the next time you will visit your bedroom and Madison can be charmed at the TV Station later.<br/>
			Use the Magnet to produce String &amp; Magnet. You will need it later.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice">
				<p>Leave your house and go to the Alley.<br/>
				Cast Clairvoyance, then use the String &amp; Magnet to get the Rusty Key.</p>
			</div>			
			<h3>Meet Amy</h3>
			<p>Go to Cherise Road, you may see a removal truck, this is just announcing the new neighours Janet and Debra who you will meet later.<br/>
			Visit the Gym and meet Amy Ross. You cannot charm her here.</p>
			<h3>Meet Leanne</h3>
			<p>Walk to the shopping center, but before visiting the General Store, make sure you have less than 20$ and deposit any excess at the ATM Machine.<br/>
			Enter the General Store and meet Leanne, ask all questions. Buy a shovel (15$) and scissors (5$), you will need them later in the game. You can also buy a paperweight (3$) to obtain some mana next time you visit the Wild Ranges.<br/>
			Chat with Leanne, then agree to look after the store. There are no longer any consequences if you decide to take the money, you are just betraying your friends trust.<br/>
			There is a random chance a woman will flash her tits to you when you visit the store, but there is no way to charm her. <br/>
			Since you can't charm Leanne yet, exit the store.</p>			
			<h3>Meet Ellie</h3>
			<p>Visit the Bank, note this can be done at the same time as depositing money above.</p>
			<div class="path path-conspiracy path-murder">
				<p>Speak to Ellie the bank teller and start an account.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Try to charm Ellie. It won't work, but you will need this later to trigger her charm sequence.</p>
			<p class="bold">NOTE: You can deposit up to 200$ in the bank. At a later point in the game this account limit can be raised, or if enough days pass (1 month).</p>
			<p>Exit the Bank.</p>
			<h3 id="#victoria">Charm Victoria</h3>
			<p>Enter the Antique Store and meet Victoria. Introduce yourself and chat with her, then charm her. You can now sleep here at night.<br/>
			Exit the store.</p>
			<h3 id="jenny">Charm Jenny</h3>
			<p>Enter the Restaurant and meet Jenny. Talk to her, buy a Bratwurst for 4$, then charm her immediately. You can leave for a minimal effect, or you can tell her to lower her shirt for a full enslavement.<br/>
			If you miss this opportunity, you will have to wait until you learn Shielded Charm.<br/>
			Exit the restaurant.</p>
			<h3>Visit the School</h3>
			<p>Walk to Kollam Street, then to School.<br/>
			Enter the School and visit the History Classroom. Examine the books, more than once if necessary, and read about &quot;The Gem of the Dragon&quot;. If you know the clairvoyance spell you will also find the book "Finding the Water". Repeat until the Gem book is seen, then exit the Classroom.<br/>
			Now exit the school (do not visit Mr Besley's romm yet.</p>
			<p><i>(Optional, can be skipped or missed)</i> Exit the School and you will see Davy Robbins. Follow Davy to the sports fields. Both choices are acceptable, though &quot;Approach Davy&quot; is suggested: when you return home, Tracy will give you some sexy first aid.</p>
			<p>Re-enter the school and enter Mr. Beasley's Office.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice">
				<p>Listen to the telephone message, delete it and hang up the phone.<p/>
			</div>
			<p>Pick up the Robbins' home address. Cast Pass to obtain an Old Stone.<br>
			Exit the School</p>

			<h3 id="libraryc">Charm Mrs. Adams, Ms. Titus and Monique (and possibly Angela)</h3>
			<p>Go to the Library, then to Mrs. Adams' Office and close the door. This is a good time to learn Manipulative Charms. Remember to examine your book the first time it glows, otherwise Tess won't give you the opportunity to learn new trainings!<br/>
			There are two variations to charm Mrs. Adams and Ms. Titus. The easy way is to charm Tess and complete the process, then call Ms. Titus and charm her too.<br/>
			Alternatively, to spend less mana and gain a Stone, if it's not too late (before 4:30 PM) you can follow this procedure:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Charm Tess, but do not reply and exit to the Reception Area.</li>
				<li>Follow Tess to the Town Hall.</li>
				<li>Talk to Angela, ask all options, then charm her (see below for details) and ask her where she lives and where John Adams is.</li>
				<li>Visit the office and finish the charm process, then order her to go back to the Library.</li>
				<div class="path path-apprentice">
				<li>Re-enter John Adams' office, cast clairvoyance and pick up an Old Stone, then go back to the Library.</li>
				</div>
				<div class="path path-conspiracy path-murder">
				<li>Once you learn the clairvoyance spell return to John Adams' office, cast clairvoyance and pick up an Old Stone, then go back to the Library.</li>
				</div>
				<li>Speak again with Tess in her office, invite Ms. Titus in and leave <span class="bold">without</span> charming Ms. Titus. She will become your willing slave.<br>
				If Ms. Titus is your willing slave, you can still charm her later.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="bold">NOTE: If Ms. Titus becomes your willing slave, the experience gain is delayed until you visit her house.</p>
			<p>Tell Tess to research more magic spells and leave her office.<br/>
			Ask Ms. Titus to close the Library, go to the Reference Area and charm Monique. There is no difference between watching the whole process and leaving early. Tell her to look up Magic Gems and to help you find more magic.<br/>
			Return to Ms. Titus and reopen the Library.</p>
			<div class="gender gender-male">
				<p>Speak to Ms. Titus, take the scroll she offers, and learn <span class="italic">Unstr Hun</span>, the Possession spell.<br/>
				Ask Ms. Titus what she was working on before.</p>
			</div>
			<h3 id="angela">Charm Angela</h3>
			<p>If you took the simple variation to charm Tess, make sure to enter the Town Hall, ask Angela all options and charm her. You can leave immediately for a minimal effect, or you can wait to transform her in your lover. After the spell has done it's job, ask her where she lives. You can now sleep there at night.<br/>
			Later you will be able to change her personality to be more submissive.</p>
			<h3>Meet Alison</h3>
			<p>During the daytime on a weekday <b>before</b> the next weekend, go back to School, Kollam Street and Cherise Road and visit the Gym again. This time you will meet Alison. You can't charm her yet, you will have to wait for the weekend.</p>
			<h3>Visit Tracy for First Aid (optional)</h3>
			<p>If you approached Davy outside the school visit home for some first aid from Tracy</p>
			<h3 id="mrsgranger">Charm Mrs. Granger</h3>
			<p>Walk to Yoolaroo Drive, enter the Granger's Residence and charm Mrs. Granger.<br/>
			There are four variations of this process:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Leave immediately after casting the spell for a minimal effect. When you exit the house, you obtain an Old Stone.</li>
				<li>Ask her to remove her clothes and wait for the spell to take more effect. She will be your MILF lover.</li>
				<li>Ask her to remove her clothes, tell her to strip more and tell her she needs more.  She will be your MILF slave.</li>
				<li>Ask her to remove her clothes, tell her to strip more and tell her she is a slut. She will be your Slut MILF. (Manipulative Charms only)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can now sleep here at night. Return back inside the house.</p>
			<p>Ask Mrs. Granger to explore the Wild Ranges. If it's too late, she will go/return to the Wild Ranges in the morning.<br/>
			Go to the Wild Ranges in the daytime and meet Mrs. Granger. Reward her and send her home.<br/>
			Return to Yoolaroo Drive and ask Mrs. Granger for anything she found. She will also tell you about the <span class="bold">secret tunnel</span> from the Wild Ranges to the Sacred Grove and then to Sir Roland's Mansion. You can now just walk there instead of paying for a taxi.<br/>
			Do <span class="bold">not</span> ask her yet to find the Dragon Gem.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice">
			<p>If it is night time, visit Kate's room and cast clairvoyance and check the phot-album it reveals, look at all pages. Cast clairvoyance again to check the second album.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="path path-conspiracy path-murder">
				<p>Once you learn the clairvoyance spell return and visit Kate's room and cast clairvoyance and check the phot-album it reveals, look at all pages. Cast clairvoyance again to check the second album.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="path path-murder">
				<p>After Mrs. Granger explores the Wild Ranges, at night, use the tunnel from the Wild Ranges to the Sacred Clearing to visit the Gates' Mansion.<br/>
				Enter it and ask Officer Khan what is gong on, but nothing else!</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Visit Victoria</h3>
			<p>Pay a visit to Victoria in the Antique Store in the Shopping Center and speak with her. She will become your personal assistant once charmed.</p>
			<h3>Meet Louise</h3>
			<p>Go back to the General Store and meet Louise. You can't charm her yet, you will need Shielded Charm.<br/>
			Note: it is possible she may not be here, it take a certain amount of wandering for her to be present. If Leanne is still here go to the Library and return, Louise should be here. Reapeat if needed<br>
			While you are here, remember to buy a paperweight.</p>
			<h3>Meet Esmeralda</h3>
			<p>Next on your list is the New Age Store. In the daytime enter the store and meet Esmeralda. If you have enough money, buy the Quartz Crystal (45$), Beeswax Candles (20$) and Holy Water (20$). You will need them later.<br/>
			Speak with Esmeralda, then exit the store. You can't charm her as of version 14.14.</p>
			<h3>Follow Monique</h3>
			<p>Return to School and visit the History Classroom. Speak with Monique, then send her to find more magic.</p>
			<p>Walk to the Library and go to the Reference Area for a small scene with Monique. Your choice has no effect on Monique's behaviour.</p>
			<h3>Meet Bambi and Jesse</h3>
			<p>Go to the Hotel. Inside you will find Bambi and Jesse. Speak with all of them, the order doesn't matter. There is no way to charm Jesse at this point of the story.<br/>
			Visit the Hotel Pool. Now you can call girls using your phone and have some fun in the water. Especially with slaves.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice">
				<p>You can also find Monique and Davy inside. Speak with them too, the order doesn't matter but best to talk to Monique first.</p>
				<p>If you speak to Davy, avoid visiting Principal Reagan if summoned to her office, or just promise to bring an item tomorrow. Do not visit again until later.</p>
			</div>
			<h3 id="bambi">Charm Bambi</h3>
			<p>To charm the barmaid you need to have at least 100$ with you, if you have 150$ you can see an extra scene and get a Rustic Stone.<br/>
			You can charm her anytime before going back to the bar, and you won't lose your money. Once you cast your spell, you can either go immediately to the bar for a minimal effect or wait for a full enslavement.<br/>
			Go to the bar once you're finished with her, then take her back to her room to obtain a Rustic Stone and some information about Mia. If you have at least 50 mana you'll get also some information on Donna.<br/>
			Do what you want with her, then go back to the bar.<br/>
			You can now sleep here.</p>
			<p>Come back later, take her to her room once more and ask about her career.</p>
			<h3>Visit Leanne</h3>
			<p>After you have met Louise, walk to the Graveyard and talk to Leanne. Again, you can't charm her yet.</p>
			<h3 id="nina">Meet Nina and Gabby</h3>
			<p>During the daytime, go to the TV Station and introduce yourself to the receptionist. You can't charm her yet, you will need Shielded Charm.<br/>
			If you charmed Madison at the beginning of the chapter, ask Nina to see her. If instead you sent her away or didn't answer the door, ask to see the person who delivered your prize. You can charm her right now. If you gave the wrong answer to the telephone quiz, you will have to wait some more.</p>
			<p>If you can visit Madison, you'll first have an encounter with Gabby, your mother's assistant. She will be pleased if you refer to her as &quot;Ms Halliway&quot;, but your answer won't have consequences.</p>
			<h3 id="zoey">Charm Zoey</h3>
			<p>After visiting Madison, you have the opportunity to charm her co-worker. After you leave the TV Station, Madison will inform you of Zoey's existence via SMS. Go back and ask her about the other delivery girl. When Zoey is in office, Madison will send you an SMS. Go back quickly to the TV Station, ask to see Madison and charm Zoey. You can either turn her into a slut (Manipulative Charms only) or a slave.<br/>
			This may take more than one try, Zoey is not always at work when you arrive there.</p>
			<h3>Visit the Library - Part 2</h3>
			<p>Go to School and once again visit the History Classroom. Speak with Monique, all options.<br/>
			Examine the books in the bookcase, you should find &quot;The Settlement of Glenvale&quot;.<br/>
			<div class="gender gender-male">
			Read the extra pages and pick up the Rustic Stone. Only available if you have learned the Possession spell from Ms Titus.<br/>
			</div>
			<div class="gender gender-female">
			Return here after you learn the Possession spell and search for the extra pages and a rustic stone<br/>
			</div>
			Next go to the Library<br/>
			<div class="gender gender-male">
			Tell Ms. Titus about the early settlers.<br>
			</div>
			Now go to the Reference area and ask Monique to look for details on Magic Gems<br>
			Finally visit Tess' office and speak with her. She should have finished her research by now. If she does, order her to come to your house. It's also a good moment to learn Masculine Cantrips.</p>
			<h3>Visit your Home</h3>
			<p>Pay a visit to your home. You will meet Tess speaking with your Mother and Sister.<br/>
			If it's not too late you should also receive an SMS from Angela: the Mayor is ready to see you!<br/>
			Go to your room and tell Tess you like her outfit/nightie (depending on the time of the day), then ask if she has other magic artifacts. Finally tell her to ask her husband.</p>
			<h3>Meet Gina</h3>
			<p>Go to the Library, then to the Museum. Inside you will meet the security guard, but you can't charm her yet. Look around, make sure to <span class="bold">examine</span> the Vase and the Painting, but <span class="bold">don't touch</span> anything yet.<br/>
			Exit the Museum.</p>
			<h3>Meet Abby</h3>
			<p>Visit the Aquarium and ask for help from the information desk. You can't charm Abby yet, you will need Shielded Charm.</p>
			<h3>Meet Debra Kelly</h3>
			<p>Walk to the School, then to the Park. Approach the girl in the Park Pathway and tell her you live in Kollam Street too to obtain her address.</p>
			<h3>Meet Nurse Sandra</h3>
			<p>Walk to the Park Bridge, then to the Hospital. Once inside, look at the picture to meet Nurse Sandra.</p>
			<h3 id="janetkelly">Charm Janet Kelly</h3>
			<p>Return in Kollam Street and visit the Kelly's Residence. Speak with Janet, all options, then charm her. There are four variations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exit the house for a minimal effect.</li>
				<li>Follow up the stairs and tell her she forgets where her room is, to turn Janet into a mindless bimbo (Manipulative Charms only).</li>
				<li>Follow up the stairs and tell her you want her too, to turn Janet into your lover.</li>
				<li>Follow up the stairs and take her now, to turn her into your slave.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Speak with her, all options.</p>
			<h3>Charm Debra Kelly (optional)</h3>
			<p>Go to the Park and approach Debra Kelly. If you tell her Janet needs help unpacking, you can lure Debra to her home and charm her right away and make her your girlfriend. If instead you choose to let her remain here, you set her to the path of becoming your puppy-girl, but will need to know the Shielded Charm spell to enslave her. This variant has the advantage of giving you the option to make Debra search for Magic Stones in the Park.</p>
			<h3>Visit Tess Adams</h3>
			<p>Walk to the Hotel, inside you will find Tess waiting for you. Ask her what she has found, then take her to a private room. Feel free to ask her to show off more.<br/>
			Try to solve the worm's puzzle. The answers are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Missing letter and number</span> first interpretation, hint: <span class="hidden">how do numbers and letters progress?</span> solution: <span class="hidden">&quot;20&quot; and &quot;U&quot;</span></li>
				<li><span class="bold">Missing letter and number</span> second interpretation, hint: <span class="hidden">if I is 9th, P is...</span> solution: <span class="hidden">&quot;16&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;</span></li>
				<li><span class="bold">Number sequence</span> hint: <span class="hidden">every line &quot;reads&quot; the previous</span> solution: <span class="hidden">13112221</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you solve the puzzle you get 20 mana and learn <span class="italic">Al Mass</span>, the Transform spell.<br/>
			Reward your slave, if you so wish, but <span class="bold">don't</span> train with her. Exit the Hotel.</p>
			<h3 id="johnadams">Charm John Adams</h3>

				Use the Silver Ring, then charm her.<br/>

			Tell Tina to free your sister, then charm her. You can tell her you love her as a man/woman to turn her into your lover, or that you love her as a sibling, to avoid incest. If you choose the latter, you won't be able to have sex with your mother when you can finally charm her.<br/>
			If you choose the incest path, take Tracy to her room and choose &quot;Well...&quot; to go further along this path with your mother, or &quot;No, she is my mother!&quot; to limit yourself to your sister.</p>

			<p>You can either go to the Library or the Antique store. If you go to the Library ask Monique to research seance, then examine and pick up the article. If you go to the Antique store ask Victoria about Janet's papers, then examine them.<br/>
			You now have all the material to perform the ritual, but if you try Kurndorf will possess your body. You need magical protection to succeed.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice">
				<p>Go see Sir Ronald and give him the Old Key. He will give you the Aftane.<br/>
				While you are there, ask about the Blue Bottle and the Charm spell.</p>

				<p>Return to the Hotel Cellar and use the key to get the Wine Bottle.</p>
				<p>Go to the Police Station (quickly if it's almost midnight) and order Officer Batton to remove the officer.<br/>
				If it's still early, go home to your mother's room and ask her for news around town. Otherwise this can be done later.<br/>
				Return to the Mansion and wait for midnight. You can sit on a fallen stone in the Sacred Clearing for a 30 minute wait.</p>
				<p>Cast the Pass spell to enter the Mansion. Talk to Sarah and Lauren and ask everything.<br/>
				Learn <span class="italic">Tuo Duo</span>, the Clairvoyance spell, and cast the Pass spell on the safe to get the Aftane.</p>

				<p class="bold">NOTE: Next time you meet Sarah Gates, you may have the possibility to ask her why she keeps looking outside. This is a timed event, so don't ask yet.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="path path-murder">
				<p>Go to the Shopping Center and speak with Victoria about relics.</p>
				<p>Return to the Police Station and speak with Officer Batton. You have two choices:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Order her to investigate Officer Khan's murder.</li>
					<li>Order her to investigate Officer Khan's shooting.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In the first case Officer Khan is dead, in the second she survives.</p>
				<p>Depending on what you do, the story may play out differenty. If you go from the School to the Park Pathway you get shot by Anita and start Mr. Beasley's charming process. This part of the story however is very similar to other parts, so this walkthrough chooses a different approach.<br/>
				<span class="bold">Teleport</span> to the Sacred Clearing (or ride a taxi to Sir Ronald' house) and meet Officer Adele Ross.<br/>
				Return to the Police Stationm there are two different ways here</p>
				<ul>
					<li> - passing through the Tunnel to the Wild Ranges, and walk to the park pathway, Anita will attack you and you will be shot and be sent to hospital, and Nurse Sandra will be available. <b>Only</b> do this if you have charmed Officer Batton <b>and</b> you have a magical defence like Gina's necklace, Pamela's bracelet or know Alison's chant</li>
					<li> - passing through the Tunnel to the Wild Ranges, now teleport back. Avoid the park pathway.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Now ask Officer Batton what her investigation revealed.<br/>
				Finally order her to withdraw the police from the Gates estate.</p>
				<p>Go home once again and speak with your mother. This time ask her for news from around town, and nothing else.</p>
				<p>Finally, visit the Gates' Mansion and speak with Sarah Gates. Ask about the Aftane and the Blue Bottle, then tell her you killed her uncle/you saw his murderers or that you are a detective.<br/>
				Charm her and pick up the Wooden Box. Talk more to Sarah, ask again about the Blue Bottle (pick it up) and the Aftane (cast Pass on the safe).</p>
				<p class="bold">NOTE: Next time you meet Sarah Gates, you may have the possibility to ask her why she keeps looking outside. This is a timed event, so don't ask yet.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Now that you have the Aftane, you can perform the ritual. Go to the Hotel and tell Jesse about the secret room, but she is only present in the daytime. Then enter the witch's prison.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice path-murder">
				<p>Ask Jessica about the Blue Bottle.</p>
			</div>
			<p><b>Important: if you wish to en-slave or ally with Jessica later you must know the training "Defending your self with Magic" learned from Alison and have at least 20 mana.</p></b></p>
			<p>Start the seance. If you tried to help Jessica, you have the possibility to check why did Jessica cry out. This will enable bondage scenes for her and to free her or enslave her later.<br/>
			Ask Kurndorf how he's doing, then talk to Jesse. Ask her what you should call her, then give in to temptation and kiss her.<br/>
			Speak with Kurndorf, all options. He will teach you a ritual that requires Salt, Chalk, Candles, a Quartz Crystal, a Lock of your Hair, a Dagger, a Chalice, a Human Skull and some Hemlock.<br/>
			Go back up to the Hotel Bar. Bambi will take care of the Cellar.</p>
		</div>
		<h2 onclick="hide('ch4')">Chapter 4: The Ritual</h2>
		<div id="ch4" class="spoiler" style="display: none;">

				When you leave the mansion Lauren will approach you, go upstairs and check the room, watch, do not enter. You can refuse or leave early, if you do you will offend Sarah, but in 2 days she will message you and allow you to visit her in her room, with a small bonus scene.</p>
				<p>Make sure to periodically visit to get more events with Sarah, you will get a pattern of ask a few questions then do a single diversion like go swimming, have a drink etc. You can ask 2 questions a day and do one diversion.</p>
				<p>The diversions become tests for Sarah, and you will be asked a riddle each time, once you pass 6 riddles Sarah will consider you worthy and consider you for more intimate diversions.</p>
				<p>Puzzles:<br/>

			<p>Next go to School. Cast Pass to enter if it's closed and go to History Classroom. Examine the bookcase (at least) five times, you should find books on Hydromancy, on the death of Kurndorf, on the witches of Pennsylvania, a missing book on demons and a book on rituals under the Broken Inn.<br/>
			Exit the School.</p>
			<p>If you have time to waste, it's a good idea to invest some of it in inscribing hexagrams in key places. Library, Town Hall, Police Station, Museum and Hospital are suggested.</p>
			<h3 id="logan">Charm Miss. Logan (start)</h3>
			<p>As soon as the weekend passes, go to the Restaurant. You may find Donna inside, watch her scene, then enter again.<br/>
			There is a possibility that you meet Miss Logan here. Otherwise you can find her at School, but the following events are the same.<br/>
			Ask to do the reproductive assignment. You can meet her later at School and charm her.<br/>
			<span class="bold">NOTE: This is a one-time event. If you choose the neurology assignment, there is a more complex charm process for her.</span></p>
			
			<h3 id="mrstanika">Charm Mrs. Tanika</h3>
			<p>Next go to School and visit the Teacher's Lounge. Inside you will find Mrs. Tanika, your math teacher. Say hello to her, then charm her. There are four variations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can leave immediately for a minimal effect.</li>
				<li>Tell her she lookd\s troubled to turn her into your lover (Manipulative Charms only).</li>
				<li>Slap her and turn her into your slave.</li>
				<li>Slap her and turn her into your fucktoy (Manipulative Charms only).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the last two cases Mrs. Tanika will be transferred to your room at home.</p>
			<div class="gender gender-female">
				<p>Go to Mr. Beasley's office.</p>
				<p class="path path-apprentice">Tell him that you have the book, but don't give it to him.</p>
				<p>Ask about the spell and his compensation. You can pay 100$ and learn a new spell, or charm him if you know "Masculine Charms", go back into the office and learn it for free.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="path path-murder">
				<p>Enter Ms. Jones' Office and speak with her, then use the Silver Ring and then cast charm on her. Enter the office again and speak with her.<br/>
				Cast Pass to go to Anita's secret lair. Use the Silver Ring and cast charm on her immediately, then pick up the bag and the Blue Key. Every other choice will result in you being shot or Anita fleeing.<br/>
				Order Anita to prove her loyalty, then redeploy her.</p>
				<p>Now that you have both the Wooden Box and the Blue Key, you can repeat this process as much as desired to increase your mana:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Go to the Sacred Clearing.</li>
					<li>Use the Blue Key to open the Wooden Box.</li>
					<li>Pick up a Granite Pebble, it turns into a Rustic Stone.</li>
					<li>Enter the Tunnel and go to the Wild Ranges.</li>

				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>Quickly go to the Wild Ranges and come back to the School. Visit the Anatomy Classroom, cough to attract Miss Logan's attention, then charm her.<br/>
			You can ask your teacher what she means for the standard charm, or ask about pratical reproduction to turn her into a breeder (Manipulative Charms only).</p>
			<p>Next visit the Town Hall. An optional event with Mayor Thomas, Angela and Officer Batton can happen when all three are charmed. They will discuss working together and offer to look in the town's documents to find informations about Kurndorf.<br/>
			Ask Angela to look for magic places.</p>
			<p>Go to the Sacred Clearing and pick up both Old Stones.</p>
			<p>Now that all distractions are cleared, we can concentrate on Kurndorf's ritual.</p>
			<p>Go home and pick up the Salt. While you are here, use the scissors to obtain a Lock of your Hair. If you don't have the scissors, you can buy them in the General Shop. You'll also need the Shovel.<br/>
			Go to your room and drop useless items, such as the Scissors and various writings you may have picked up during the game. You can find them in the Chest in your room.<br/>
			Ask Tess to train you and learn Conserving Magic.<br/>
			Quartz and Candles can be bought at the New Age Store. If you still have to buy them, take the Holy Water too.<br/>
			Chalk can be found in the Teacher's Lounge, at School. Optionally you can cast Clairvoyance for 25$.</p>
			<h3 id="desiree">Church and Charm Sister Desiree</h3>
			<p>Visit the Graveyard. Cast Clairvoyance and then Pass to discover the Mausoleum, then cast Clairvoyance again and enter the Secret Tunnel.</p>
			<p>In the Church Catacombs there is a Skull you can use in the ritual, but will lead to a bad ending, so leave it there.<br/>
			Go on in the Church Stores and pick up the Silver Dagger.<br/>
			Walk up the stairs and enter the Church. Try to pick up the Ritual Chalice and you will be stopped by Mother Superior. Right now you can't go anywhere except outside, so leave the Church.</p>
			<p>Walk around the outer wall and approach the would-be gardener. She is here only during the day, so if it's night you'll have to come back later. Speak with her, all options, then charm her.<br/>
			Talk to Pamela some more and ask about her symptoms. Have sex with her as you prefer and ask about her Necklace. Finally order her to show you how to get into the Church.</p>
			<p>Approach the good Sister, request her absolution and thank her, then charm Sister Desiree.</p>
			<p>Go back to the front of the Church and attune the hexagram.</p>
			<p>There are only two ways at the moment to leave this place, either by taxi or with the Teleport spell. Whatever your choice is, go to the Wild Ranges.<br/>
			Use Clairvoyance to find the Hemlock, then use the Shovel. The answers to the puzzle are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">One is vain</span> <span class="hidden">modest</span></li>
				<li><span class="bold">A maker</span> <span class="hidden">mason</span></li>
				<li><span class="bold">A guard</span> <span class="hidden">garlic</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Examine the coffin and remove Kurndof's skull.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice path-conspiracy">
				<p>Pick up the Wooden Box. As of version 14.14 it's useless on these paths.</p>
			</div>
			<p>The only object you need is the Chalice, but in order to take it you need some help. Go to the Hotel and visit Kurndorf's ghost.<br/>
			<span class="bold">Use</span> the Salt Shaker, the Crystal, the Candles, the Chalk, the Silver Dagger, the Hemlock and Kurndorf's Skull. You can't use the Lock of Hair, it's sufficient that you have it on yourself.<br/>
			Finally complain that you can't get all the stuff for the ritual. Kurndorf will teach you <span class="italic">Dest</span>, the Invisibility spell.</p>
			<p>Visit the Church once again. Cast Invisibility and steal the Chalice.</p>
			<p>You have all the ingredients for the ritual, so go back to the Hotel and visit Kurndorf's ghost once again.<br/>
			Use the Chalice and start the ritual. You can complain various times during the ritual, but it doesn't have any effect on the outcome.<br/>
			When you have the choice, <span class="bold">don't</span> use your hair. Instead use the chip of Kurndorf's skull.</p>
			<p>After the explosion you will wake up in the Hospital. The bad news is that you lost your Book, the good news is that you can charm Nurse Sandra! But first ask her what appened.</p>
			<p>Go back to the Hotel and ask Bambi what happened, then go in the cellar and pick up the Crystal. Don't panic if you don't see it, it's right below Jessica's image. The crystal contains Kurndorf's spirit and can be used to cast the Transformation spell.</p>
			<p>Visit Victoria at the Shopping Center then Monique at the Library, and ask them about Pamela's Bracelet.<br/>
			Visit Victoria again and talk about the Bracelet, then go to the New Age Store and tell Esmeralda you have it. This is the end of this branch as of this 14.14, so your answer doesn't really matter.</p>
			<p>Go to School and visit Mr. Beasley's Office.</p>
			<div class="gender gender-male">

			Pick up the Vase. From here there are many different alternatives, with different outcomes.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Order Mrs. Granger to attack the guard. This will result in Mrs. Granger shot and hospitalized. This is also the only way to charm Nurse Megan and make Kate your girlfriend.</li>
				<li>Mrs. Granger moves to distract the guard. This will result in Mrs. Granger being arrested.</li>
				<li>Order Mrs. Granger to go home. This has no consequence on her.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Whatever your choice is, you are arrested and brought to the Police Station. Again you have different choices here, but the outcomes are very similar.</p>
			<ul>
				<li id="dianewhite">Charm Diane White immediately, or after speaking with her but before being sent to prison.</li>
				<li>Speak with Diane White, but at the end ask Officer Batton to jail her instead. You can charm her while she is behind bars.</li>
				<li>Speak with Diane White, go to jail and be tried for your actions. Never admit you are guilty, in any way. Once you are free, go back to the Police Station and charm Diane White.</li>
				<li class="path path-murder">Speak with Diane White, go to jail and ask Becky Smith to take out Diane White. This results in Diane White dead and Becky Smith injured.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Again independently of your choice, the end result is that you are free.<br/>
			Ask Officer Batton about the incident at the Museum.</p>
			<p>Pay a visit to Mr. Beasley, he has your Book.</p>
			<p>If Mrs. Granger was shot, as soon as you receive Kate's SMS, go to the Granger's house and meet her in her room. Comfort her, then use the Silver Ring. She will storm out of the house. Don't try to charm her at this point, she will react quickly and you will never see her again.</p>
			<p class="bold">NOTE: Avoid any further meetings with Kate until you are ready for the final confrontation with Davy. You can meet her at the Park Entrance or at the Duck Pond. Do not approach her until ready, or talk to her and tell her to go home and hide (it takes her some time to arrive, you have to visit key locations to trigger her arrival). The event is not timed.<br/>
			Warning: If you ask anyone about Davy, where he is or if they have seen him then Kate will be summoned back to the Hotel and stay there with Davy, blocking this event.</p>
			<p>Go to the Hospital, enter the ICU and ask about Mrs. Granger.<br/>
			Leave the ICU and go to the upper floor. There you can ask for the Nurse's name, but you can't charm her yet, you will need Shielded Charm.<br/>
			While you are here, visit the Basement and the Morgue, then exit the Hospital.</p>
			<p>It's time to visit the Town Hall. Enter the Mayor's Office and ask her, in this order, a key to the Hospital Basement and to close the Museum.</p>
			<p>Once the Museum is closed, it's time to break in. Go there and cast Pass to enter.<br/>
			Examine the Safe to get a Blonde Lock, then open the safe and pick up the Dragon Vase. Next check out the Security Office and pick up Gina's Address.</p>
			<p>Go to the Sacred Clearing and cast Possession. Use the Blonde Lock to possess Gina.<br/>
			Check the message, then go to the bathroom. Remove the Heirloom and look in the mirror for some sexy time.<br/>
			End the possession, either click on Gina's face in the top left corner, or click on End the spell in the right column, under Possession Spell.</p>
			<p>Optionally, if you have enough mana, you can possess Gina again for an extra scene. Remember the message?</p>
			<p>You now know where Gina lives and that she has no protection. Go to Rathdown Rd. and charm her.<br/>
			Alternatively you can order the Mayor to open the Museum and charm her there for a different sequence, but then you'd have to enter her house using the Pass spell or wait for the night.<br/>
			Visit the Bathroom and take the Necklace.</p>
			<p>Visit the Mayor at the Town Hall and ask her to open the Museum.</p>
			<p>Finally go to the Hospital and enter Ward 1 West (or to the Granger's house if Mrs. Granger wasn't wounded) and ask Mrs. Granger about the Vase. She will come out of the Hospital in 18 days, unless you heal her with the Vampyre later.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice path-conspiracy">
				<p>Officer Khan is here. Charm her.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="path path-murder">
				<p>Pay a visit to Officer Khan in Ward 1 East, if she is alive. She should be healed by now and ready to return to the Police Station. If she is still wounded, wait one day or more, eventually she will recover completely.</p>
			</div>
			<p>As soon as you receive an SMS from Diane White (probably you have to wait one day), visit her at the Police Station and ask about the charges. Talk to Diane, ask everything but don't tell her to return to the Police Station.<br/>
			Go back to Gina's house and talk to her. If you haven't charmed Madison, talk again to Diane, same as before.<br/>
			Go to the TV Station and once again talk to Diane. If you didn't before, you can finally charm Madison now. Remember to look how to charm Zoey too.<br/>
			Ask to see Madison, talk again to Diane, then cast Pass. As soon as you have the documents, talk to Diane one last time and watch the scene to the end.</p>
			<p>The next time you visit Diane's apartment and she is not home, you'll find a book. Read it to gain 10 mana.</p>
			<p>Go to the Shopping Center and enter the Mechanic's Workshop. Give Hannah the Vase and ask her to break it.<br/>
			You can examine the gem and click on the image to learn a new spell, but for a better outcome go to the Library and talk to Monique about the Vase.<br/>
			Return to the Mechanic's Workshop, perform a quick stress-test if you like and have Monique teach you <span class="italic">Neo One</span>, the Shielded Charm spell.</p>
			<p>Use your new spell to charm Hannah, then ask Monique to return to the Library. You'll be able to ask her to go to the Mechanic's Workshop anytime and have access to their apartment at night. For the moment though don't visit their apartment nor ask Monique and Hanna to service your ride, it will trigger Camryn's rescue sequence and as of version 14.8.4 Monique will be unavailable for the whole day because of a bug.</p>
			<p>For an alternate scene you can ask Hannah to help you cut some chains and charm her after she does her job. Otherwise ask her after she is charmed and decide what to do with Jessica. You can free her or just loose her binds.<br/></p>
		</div>
		<h2 id="davy" onclick="hide('ch6')">Chapter 6: Davy Robbins</h2>
		<div id="ch6" class="spoiler" style="display: none;">
			<p>Davy has been around for too much. It' time he pays for his misdeeds.</p>
			<p>Visit Kate at the Park. She can be either at the Park Entrance or at the Duck Pond. Ask her about Davy, then use the Silver Ring on her. Don't try to charm her, it's a bad idea. There are a few possibilities here now, depending on your present and past choices.</p>
			<p>If you ignored or insulted her at the beginning of the game, she won't accept your help whatever you say.<br/>
			Follow her to the Hotel, enter Room 101 and use the Silver Ring on Davy. You could also use the Blue Bottle, but you won't gain any mana. Nod and think she is an ungrateful bitch, deal with Davy and his phone, then teleport inside the Granger's house.<br/>
			Visit Kate's room and either hide in the wardrobe or cast Invisibility. Wait for Kate (it may take a while) and when she arrives charm her. You can make her your lover (Manipulative Charms only) or your slave.</p>
			<p>If you instead helped her with the math problem, there are two ways to get rid of Davy. You can protect her and give her Gina's Necklace (but make sure you have Pamela's Bracelet!), or you can confess your love, offer your help, kiss her and embrace her.<br/>
			Follow her to the Hotel and stop her to work out a plan. If you protected her, she will just smash Davy, otherwise you have a few additional alternatives, all of them requiring the use of the Blue Bottle or the Silver Ring.<br/>
			Deal with Davy and his phone, then reach Kate at her home. If you protected her, you can hypnotize her to make her fall in love with you, then take the necklace back.<br/>
			If you want to, at this point you can charm Kate and she won't strike back. It may seem a waste of mana since you have come this far to make her your willing girlfriend, but then you must also consider that you don't gain experience from her being your willing girlfriend and if charmed you have access to mother-daughter scenes, once Mrs. Granger returns home.</p>
			<p>Revisit Davy in Room 101 at the Hotel for a small training session with Bambi. You can also bring Tina here and steal some of his mana, starting from the next day.<br/>
			It's not possible to transform him into a girl or charm him here. You'll have to wait until you can transfer him in the cellar.</p>
			<p>Once you have charmed Anita visit her and have sex. You will get an option to have her take care of Davy.</p>
			<div class="path path-murder">
				<p>There are two options,</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="bold">take care</span> - if you select this Anita will kill Davy and dispose of the body</li>
					<li><span class="bold">look after</span> - if you select this she will imprison him in the hotel cellar</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="path path-apprentice path-conspiracy">
				<p>There are two options,</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="bold">take care</span> - if you select this Anita would kill Davy but you stop her. Nothing more can be done.</li>
					<li><span class="bold">look after</span> - if you select this she will imprison him in the hotel cellar</li>
				</ul>
			</div>	
			<p>Pick the option to imprison him in the cellar. Visit the hotel for an event with Bambi and Anita. Now they will alternate as guards for Davy, Anita in the daytime, Bambi at night.</p>
			<p>You can now transform Davy to a female if you wish using the Transform spell.</p>
			<p>Visit Davy several days in a row (3 at least) but bring his sister Tina with you and have her 'drain' him. This will reduce the residual effects from Kurndorf.</p>
			<p>Now you can charm him. You will them be able to return him/her to the Robbins house</p>
		</div>
		<h2 onclick="hide('ch7')">Chapter 7: The Demon</h2>
		<div id="ch7" class="spoiler" style="display: none;">
			<div class="path path-apprentice">
				<p>Go speak with Sir Ronald Gates and ask him about demons.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="path path-conspiracy path-murder">
				<p>Go speak with Sarah Gates and ask her about demons.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Next ask Bambi, Mayor Thomas or Officer Batton about a gentleman's club. You can also ask Catherine, if she is already your slave.<br/>
			The club is accessible from the Shopping Center and is open from 22:00. Go there, speak with Jade and pay the price you prefer to obtain informations and an Old Stone. You'll also find informations on Elian if you used Hydromancy.<br/>
			If you try to charm her, she'll resist the attempt. As of version 14.14 there is no way to enslave her.</p>
			<p>Now go to the Park Pathway and speak with Jesse. Ask every option but don't kiss her or it's game over.</p>
			<p>Visit the Library, go and do something else, or leave and return to the Library. Then come back home and talk to Mom: Jesse will pay a visit to your house. If she isn't there, keep visiting the Library and other key locations until she arrives. Speak with your mother, but avoid discussing about Tracy.<br/>
			Check on your visitor and, if you want to have sex with Mom, ask what she did to her. In general avoid kissing her and find out what she wants from you.</p>
			<p>Visit your mother. It's time to talk about Tracy with her. Tell her you are lovers if you charmed Tracy as a lover and want to do the same to your mother, otherwise choose whatever you prefer.<br/>
			Optionally have sex with Tracy right after for a slightly different scene when you'll charm Mom.</p>
			<p>Come back 2 hours later and visit Mom's Room to find her masturbating. You can retreat embarassed or, if you want to have sex with her, aroused.</p>
			<p>Visit her room once more and she goes to work.</p>
			<p>Next go to the Graveyard. Leanne is still there, but she was enthralled by Legion. If you take her now, she will remember and be offended when you free her. This means you'll only be able to charm her as a slave, not as a lover.</p>
			<p>You need to ask some questions to find the Relic for Jesse. First go talk to the New Age Store owner and Victoria. Then go to the Church and ask both Pamela and Sister Desiree.</p>
			<p>Return in front of the Library to receive a phone call from Jesse. The two possible answers these no longer matter to the game, choose based on your preferences.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Clit:</span> a lesbian scene</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Cock:</span> a futanari scene</li>
			</ul>
			<p>While you are here, speak with Monique and ask about the Hypnosis Book.</p>
			<p>Jesse's phone call signals that Sister Desiree finished her investigation. Return to the Church Courtyard and acknowledge your disciple's failure.<br/>
			Tell her to recite her scripture and continue the dialogue. She will bring you a personal item belonging to the Mother Superior.<br/>
			Visit some key locations, then come back. You'll know Sister Desiree ended her work when you'll find Pamela sad. Ask her what happened, then speak with Sister Desiree and take the Rosary.</p>
			<p>Go to the Sacred Clearing and use the Possession spell on the Rosary.<br/>
			As Mother Superior take the thrall, then cast Clairvoyance in Mother Superior's Room. Pick up the Catholic Relic, bring it to Sister Desiree and end the possession.</p>
			<p>Again visit the Church and finally take the Relic from your disciple's hands. Jesse must be watching you, because as soon as you have the Relic, she calls you on the phone and tells you where to find her.</p>
			<p>If you don't have the Holy Water yet, you have to buy it now. You can also ask Victoria about the Relic for more details.</p>
			<p>Go to the Hotel, Room 113. Interrupt Jesse, then tell you don't want to keep her from enjoying her pet. This is the moment to strike: use the Holy Water on the Catholic Relic, then give the anointed Relic to Jesse.</p>
			<p class="bold">NOTE: If you use the Holy Water before entering the room or exit after using the Holy Water, its effect wears off and if you don't pay attention you'll fail the mission. If Jesse receives the Relic without the Holy Water, she will leave town.</p>
			<p>Take the Stone the thrall is offering you, then go back downstairs. Bambi will take care of Jesse and the thrall. As of version 14.14 there is no way to charm them, but Jesse will at least get better after four days and you can invite her to the Swimming Pool.<br/>
			The other thrall, Seraphina, can be found at the strip club, later you will be able to rescue her, once Legion is defeated.</p>
			<p>Now it's time to think of your mother. The day after she leaves she will call you, asking for clothes. Go to her bedroom and collect them.<br/>
			If you want to have sex with her, the clothes are hot, otherwise they are awkward.</p>
			<p>Go to the TV Station, but before bringing your mother her clothes, charm Nina at the Reception. You'll need her help in a moment.<br/>
			If you order her to take off her shirt she will become your slave, if you tell her she is desirable she will instead become your girlfriend (Manipulative Charms only). However as of version 14.8.4 there seems to be no difference between the two choices.</p>
			<p>Now you can finally deliver the clothes. Enter Mom's office and, while you are here, ask Gabby about the Hypnosis Book, then give the suitcase to your mother.<br/>
			At this point the clock is ticking. You have five days to charm your mother and Gabby, or you'll lose them.</p>
			<p>A first hint on what to do can be found speaking with Nina. Listen to her, then talk to her.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice path-conspiracy">
				<p>While you wait for the night, visit the General Store. Inside you may find Anita. Speak with her twice, then charm her. If you call her a slut she will go directly to your house, if you instead call her a patriot (Manipulative Charms only) she goes behind the French classroom and you get a bag. In this case you can go there, have sex with her and redeploy her to your bedroom, but don't talk about Davy yet.</p>
				<p>After you have charmed Anita, go to School. You'll find a new room, Ms. Jones' office. Enter it, use the Silver Ring and charm her. Anita's hideout can be accessed from here; if she didn't go to your bedroom redeploy her, then go back to Ms. Jones.<br/>
				Ask about her eagerness to serve and all following dialogues.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Come back at the TV Station at night to better understand what is happening. You can enter the building, but you'll need to cast Pass once inside.<br/>
			Look into your Mom's office and keep watching. The scene is different (i.e. sexier) if you wait for two days after Mom's call. Then check Gabby's office and learn about her schedule.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice path-conspiracy">
				<p>You can see only one of the two scenes with Mom and Gabby on this path. Choose wisely, or use wisely your saves.</p>
				<p>Speak with Sarah Gates or Mayor Thomas about the upcoming event. They will make sure you can enter and isolate Gabby to charm her. If you choose Sarah you'll also have a first encounter with Sofia.<br/>
				As of version 14.8.4 Sarah seems to be bugged on Conspiracy Path, there is no way to enter the Mansion once you exit. You can either go to the Mayor, use the cheats to wait inside the mansion or use the cheats to teleport to location 192.<br/>
				Sarah wants something in return for her favor, while Mayor Thomas won't ask anything, but you'll need extra information from Mr. Beasley or Adele Ross, if you already charmed her.</p>
				<p>Some time before 18:00 the next day go to the girl you chose and get ready.<br/>
				At the conference you can speak freely with Sarah and Mayor Thomas, this part is not timed.<br/>
				Finally wait for the signal and speak with Reporter Julie. As of version 14.10 she can't be charmed.<br/>
				Enter the room with Gabby and charm her. You can turn her into a masochist slave, rile her up to transform her into your hateful lover (Manipulative Charms only) or make her your mother's servant. In this case she will come to your home during the weekend. Pick up her necklace, you'll need it in a few moments.<br/>
				If you are here with Sarah and you choose to have sex with Gabby (you can't if she is your Mom's servant) you can ask Sarah to join in.</p>
				<p>When you are finished with Gabby, go to her home and save your mother.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="path path-murder">
				<p>You can see both scenes with Mom and Gabby on this path if you delay the following actions.</p>
				<p>Speak with Mr. Beasley or Sarah Gates about Gabby's Necklace. You can also ask Adele Ross, if you already charmed her.</p>
				<p>Soon Nina will tell you Gabby and Mom are leaving the office and give you Gabby's address.<br/>
				If you go inside alone it's game over, so bring Tina with you. You can also bring the Vampyre if it's night and you already charmed her, but if she is almost full you'll meet a bad end.</p>
				<p>If you are with Tina, make your helper take care of the protection, then charm Gabby.<br/>
				If you are with the Vampyre you can make Gabby talk and at any moment unleash Lilith to turn Gabby into a ghoul.<br/>
				In both cases, if you are interested in having sex with Mom lie to her about your intentions.</p>
				<p>When you charm her, you can turn Gabby into your hateful lover (Manipulative Charms only), masochist slave or your mother's servant. In this case she will come to your home during the weekend. Pick up her necklace, you'll need it in a moment.</p>
			</div>
			<p></p>
			<p>Now it's your Mom's turn. To be able to have sex with her, follow this sequence. Speak with her, use Gabby's Necklace and tell her you are her mistress, then charm her. Go all the way, tell her she is very sexy and that she keeps teasing you (or so was watching you and Tracy if you had sex after confessing you and Tracy are lovers). Next tell her having needs is not bad and you are attractive grown-ups. Finally ask her to undress and if she likes when you and Tracy look at her body and assure her she is in charge. She is now yours.</p>
			<p>Enter Gabby's house again and ask her about the necklace and continue the conversation.</p>

		<h2 onclick="hide('ch8')">Chapter 8: Charm As If There's No Tomorrow - Part 2</h2>
		<div id="ch8" class="spoiler" style="display: none;">
			<p>It's time for another round of charms! Some will be really easy and quick to perform, while others may require a few days to complete. Feel free to follow various parts at the same moments if you want to avoid spending a lot of time waiting for the next event.</p>
			
			<h3 id="abby">Charm Abby</h3>
			<p>Estimated time: less than 1 hour.</p>
			<p>Next on the list is Abby, at the Aquarium. You can go away at the beginning of the process for a minimal enslavement, or ask for her help. If at any moment you take it to the next level, you go straight to the end of the charming prosess, if however you watch her strip tease fully and pay attention to her story, you'll be rewarded with a Gold Stone.</p>
			<p>Go again to the Information Desk and ask about the Dragon Gem, then let her accompany you to the Mechanic's Workshop. Let her check the Gem and ask her to move it, she will bring it in the Hidden Room.</p>

			<h3 id="ash">Charm Ash</h3>
			<p>At the construction site, in the daytime, cast Clairvoyance to notice someone is in the office. Cast Pass to enter and meet Ash. Repeat to revisit, or just cast the charm spell. After charming her you will get a key to the office.</p>
			
			<h3 id="betty">Charm Betty</h3>
			<p>After charming Mrs Tanika and Victoria, visit the Antiques Shop and see a milk churn being sold.</p>
			<p>Go to the Park and the other pathway where you have met Debra. There is a new path leading to a farm.</p>
			<p>Go to the farm, meet Betty, check the barn for her (you cannot enter it). Return and charm her.</p>	

			<h3 id="karley">Charm Charley/Karley</h3>
			<p>Note: by default the game calls her Karley to differentiate from the character Charlie but this is selectable to the original name Charley from the bologna mod.</p>
			<p>Visit her hair salon on Dervish Rd, you require the Shielded Charm spell to charm her.</p>
			<p>She start the game charmed by Davy Robbins. You need either to use the Silver Ring to free her, or bring Tina Robbins with you and talk to Tina and ask her to free Karley</p>
			<p>Now you can charm her with Shielded Charm</p>

			<h3 id="cherry">Charm Cherry</h3>
			<p>Just visit the yoga studio and cast charm spell on her.</p>
			
			<h3 id="donna">Charm Donna</h3>
			<p>when you have at least 50 mana, visit the Hotel and take Bambi to her room. As about any new guests.</p>
			<p>Go to the Hotel Pool, introduce yourself and charm Donna.<br/>
			Visit the Hotel at night to have access to Donna's Room.</p>
			<p>You can now sleep with Donna at night</p>
			
			<h3 id="leigh">Charm Leigh Parker</h3>
			<p>After charming both Ellie and Carol talk to Ellie about the other bank teller.</p>
			<p>The following Monday Leigh will move into their home. Visit and charm her at the pool in the late afternoon, weekend, or in the spare room in the evening.</p>
			
			<h3 id="mia">Charm Mia</h3>
			<p>Estimated time: up to 8 days.</p>
			<p>Remember Bambi's mother? She is arriving in town. In order to trigger her arrival, you need to speak with Anita.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice path-conspiracy">
				<p>If you ask Anita to look after Davy, he will be moved to the Hotel Cellar, where you can transform him into a woman.<br/>
				If you ask her to take care of Davy, you'll have to cancel the order and Davy remains in Room 101. You'll receive Bambi's SMS immediately. As of version 14.8.4 the messages may be a bit confusing because of a bug.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="path path-murder">
				<p>If you ask Anita to look after Davy, he will be moved to the Hotel Cellar, where you can transform him into a woman.<br/>
				If you ask her to take care of Davy, he will be killed.</p>
			</div>
			<p>If Davy isn't in her room anymore, go to the Hotel and see what Bambi has to say. After that event, you'll receive an SMS from her.<br/>
			Go meet her at the Hotel Bar, ask about her message and follow her to the Gym.<br/>
			You can charm her immediately or wait one week, as Bambi asks. In the second case you'll have a little prize.<br/>
			If you don't charm her now, you can ask Bambi once per day to go to the Gym, where you can cast your spell, or, if Davy is in the Cellar, you can order some whisky during the night, splash Mia and charm her under the shower.<br/>
			If you plan to wait a whole week, you can visit the Hotel every day and take Bambi to her room to have a status update. As of version 14.8.4 the day 3 status report is bugged. When a week is passed she will send you an SMS. Visit her in her room and she'll give you her mother's address. The prize for your patience is the Crystal Ring. This ring can be inhabited by Keana once you charm the ghost.</p>
			
			<h3 id="rosssisters">Charm the Ross Sisters</h3>
			<p>Estimated time: 5 days or more.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice path-murder">
				<p>Visit the New Age Store, ask for a book about hypnosis and buy it for 100$.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="path path-conspiracy">
				<p>Go home and receive a delivery from Sarah Gates. It's a book about hypnosis.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Go to your room or the Library and study the hypnosis book. Then visit Mr. Beasley and learn his Hypnotic Technique.</p>
			<p>Make sure it's early in the morning or past 13:00. Go to Cherise Road and visit the Ross house. Adele will block you.<br/>
			Exit the house and Catherine will call you on the phone. You will meet her midday the following day (she is not there on the day of the phone call), so get ready, you don't have many chances.</p>
			<p>Go to Yoolaroo Drive and check the construction access road. Try to climb the fence. You can always go through casting Pass, but there is a better alternative.<br/>
			Optionally you can ask Tina Robbins to help you understand what happened at the construction site.<br/>
			Visit the Mayor and ask for a key to the construction site. Now that you can enter freely, you just have to wait until the next midday.</p>
			<p>Go to the construction site a little before midday, unlock the gate and enter.<br/>
			Wait, then when you have the possibility to leave disappointed use your phone to call Catherine or message 'where are you' and she will appear.<br/>
			You can accept her reward and she will become your willing slave, or you can charm her. You'll still be able to charm her later, if you want. As with Ms. Titus, your experience gain will be delayed until you enter her room if you accept her as willing slave.</p>
			<p>Catherine will send you an SMS in a day or two when Adele is ready to be charmed. Go to their home and charm Adele.<br/>
			Ask Catherine and Adele about Amy, then leave and visit the Wild Ranges. After some time Adele will begin to act strangely. This event has a 10% probability to happen every morning between 6:00 and 9:00 every time you move, so the best way to trigger it is to go inside a house (but not the Ross' house) and walk back and forth between two rooms.<br/>
			Go back to their home and ask Adele about Amy, then try to charm her again.</p>
			<p>Wait again for Catherine's SMS, then in the evening visit the Ross' house and hypnotize Adele, then charm her.<br/>
			Ask about Amy. See later for more on charming Amy</p>
			
			<h3 id="drkay">Charm Dr. Kristina Kay</h3>
			<p>Estimated time: less than 1 hour.</p>
			<p>After you have charmed Catherine Ross, go to the hotel and ask Bambi if there is anyone new around. You'll find a new girl in the pool. Follow her to School and you'll be given the choice of following her or asking Catherine. Catherine won't add any new detail, so follow her. Once inside her office introduce yourself and charm her. You can either push her or ask for a check-up. While the end result is the same, the check-up gives some insight on a part of the story.</p>
			<p>Later you can also visit her at the Hospital for an alternate charm scene</p>
			
			<h3 id="leanne">Charm Leanne</h3>
			<p>Estimated time: 3 days</p>
			<p>You need to speak about saving someone from a demon with Esmeralda, Victoria, Ms. Jones, Mr. Beasley and Sir Ronald Gates or Sarah Gates.</p>
			<p>Make sure the hexagram in the Hidden Room is attuned and you have learned the Precision Transitions training, otherwise you won't be able to progress. You must be carrying the Catholic Relic to save her, but it will be trapped in the Hidden Room afterwards..</p>
			<p>Now visit the Mother Superior's room in person and teleport Leanne out of there and save her.<br/>
			If for some reason Leanne runs away, you'll need the Vampyre to drag her back to the Hidden Room later.</p>
			<p>Visit Leanne at her home, then wait a couple of days and visit her again. Once you can ask her how she is holding up, she is ready to be charmed, so start talking to her. By default you turn her into your slave, but she can become your lover if you didn't take her in the Graveyard and answer her question correctly. The basic idea is to tell her the truth, but in a way she will like, or at least tolerate.</p>

				<p>First you can tell Leanne only about the Demon, or tell her about the book. Then that you are careful about who you charm. Next that something is happening in town or that you just wanted to have fun. Finally that you have considered charming her to protect her.<br/>
				At this point she has lowered her guard. Charm her and reinforce her feelings.</p>

			<h3 id="seraphina">Charm Seraphina</h3>
			<p>Estimated time: 1 days</p>
			<p>Once you see her at the Avernus Club and after Legion is defeated it is possible to sasve and charm her.</p>
			<p>You must first do part of Leanne's process above and get the Ritual of Return.</p>
			<p>Now talk to Jade at the club and she will ask for free dances at the club as a price for Seraphine. Talk to someone to arrange a dance, have them dance.</p>	
			<p>Talk to Jade at the club and she will give Sera to you. You can now lead her around town. If you are not ready for the Ritual or it is impossible tak Sera to the Broken Inn Hotel and to Jesse (or just Lucy)</p>
			<p>When ready (if you did defeat Legion) make sure the Catholic Relic is in your inventory. Do the ritual, Sera runs away and is not charmable yet anyway</p>
			<p>Talk to Bambi at the Hotel to find Sera's room. You can visit, and after some time you can charm her. Use Clairvoyance to work out how long.</p>
			
			<h3 id="daria">Charm Mother Superior</h3>
			<p>Estimated time: 3 days.</p>
			<p>After you teleported Leanne in the Hidden Room, wait a couple of days, then go to the Sacred Clearing and cast Possession using the Rosary.</p>
			<p>As Mother Superior you will have the possibility to do some naughty things, with different outcomes. If you dress back in her room you gain an extra scene, id you instead discipline Sister Desiree she will be moved to the Mother Superior room and has a small part in her charming process.<br/>
			It doesn't matter what you choose, she will fall for your spell in any case now.</p>
			<p>Go to the Church, in Mother Superior's room, and charm her. Her will is still too strong, but now you can hypnotize her and charm her immediately after. There is a slight variant in her charming process. If you tell her that her heart is yours and that she can only ask you for help, she will acknowledge you are her warlock master/witch mistress. Finally talk about something bothering her to conclude the process. This variant has no other effect outside of the charming process as of version 14.8.4.</p>
			
			<h3 id="miku">Charm Miku</h3>
			<p>Estimated time: up to 2 days.</p>
			<p>Visit Abby at the Aquarium after a couple days you charmed her and you may find her speaking with Miku. Greet the pair, then try to charm Miku. The choice has no consequence, so you can give in if you want to see the scene. Ask Abby what appened and talk about Miku's magical skills.</p>
			<p>Go back home and enter the attic. Miku is there waiting for you, speak with her. What you answer about your sister has no consequence. Accept to have her live here, otherwise you won't see her again. If she asks why you haven't charmed your mother yet, the answer has no consequence on her nor on the charming of your mother. Miku will return later.</p>
			<p>You need to speak with Victoria, Esmeralda, Mr. Beasley, Monique, Tina, Ms. Jones and Sir Ronald Gates or Sarah Gates (not everybody is available on every path). You may also ask Davy, if it's your prisoner, but won't give you any useful information. After that you have all the elements to charm her.</p>
			<p>Visit Miku in the attic and review your findings with her. Then ask her about her behaviour and her family and finally confirm you have everything you need. Cast Transform on her and watch the whole strip tease, then instead of focusing on suppressing the influence of the crystal, cast Charm. If you don't, Kurndorf possesses Miku and it's game over.</p>
			
			<h3 id="kristin">Charm Kristin the Bank Manager</h3>
			<p>Estimated time: 4 days.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice">
				<p>To charm the Bank Manager you'll need a Letter of Credit. Once you have it go speak with the Bank Manager, give her the Letter of Credit and charm her.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="path path-conspiracy path-murder">
				<p>Go to the Bank and ask Ellie to speak to the bank manager. This is a one-time event, so if you miss it, you can't charm Kristin anymore.<br/>
				Introduce yourself, but don't apply for a credit card. Instead charm her.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Once you enter the Bank you should also meet a security guard, Nella. She can be charmed, see later for details.</p>
			<p>Visit Kristin's office again, order her to remove your bank account limit and ask her about Ellie. Do <span class="bold">not</span> ask her to close the Bank, this is a one-time event covered below.<br/>
			If the option to close the Bank is not visible, it means you didn't try to charm Ellie at your first meeting. Do it now, you'll need it.</p>
			<p>One day after you have charmed Kristin (and have Angela and the Mayor under your spell), you will receive an SMS from Angela. Go to the Town Hall for an extra scene.</p>

			<h3 id="elliecarol">Charm Ellie and Carol</h3>
			<p>Estimated time: a few hours.</p>
			<p>Make sure it's not too late in the afternoon. Visit the Bank Manager Kristin and ask her to close the bank, but remember that this is a one-time event.<br/>
			Visit the Bartel's residence on Dervish Street and talk to her mother. You can't charm her yet, so you have to resort to lies.</p>
			<p>If you tell her you are from the Bank, go to the Park, at the pond, and meet Ellie there. You can free her now and follow her to Kristin's home, where you can charm her, or talk to her and follow her to Davy's room, where you can free her with the Silver Ring, but don't watch her phone. Once freed, you can either charm her here, or follow her to Kristin's home and cast your spell there.<br/>
			Next visit Ellie at home, call her mother and charm her.</p>
			<p>If you instead tell Carol you are selling subscriptions, visit Kristin and ask her about her neighbours. If you order her to tell you, you won't be able to charm Carol, so ask her again. While you wait for Kristin's call enter her house and take the Old Stone. Next enter the Bartel's house and charm Carol. Enter again and ask where Ellie is. Use the Silver Ring and charm her.</p>
			<p>In both cases Ellie can be turned into your slave, or your lover (Manipulative Charms only).</p>
			<p>Speak with Carol and ask her all the questions.</p>
			<p>Finally, return to Kristin and tell her to re-open the Bank.</p>

			<p>The next morning go to Cherise Road and call Kylie again for a second scene. Repeat once more and learn of their neighbour Melanie.</p>
			<p>The following day visit the Gym and meet Aunt Brandi. Try to charm her, it will fail. Return home and talk to Mom about arranging to visit Aunt Brandi and Kylie.</p>
			<p>The following weekend visit Mom in her room in the evening and she will go out with Aunt Brandi. The following morning talk to Mom and you can now visit Aunt Brandi and Kylie at their home in the evening (8:30 to 10:30).</p>
			<p>Visit and go to Kylies room and play until Aunt Brandi peeks. Ask all questions. Leave the bedroom and ask all questions. Get the 'What to do' prompt.</p>
			<p>Talk to Mom, then either (or both)</p>
			<ul>

Choose <b>she dominates</b> to follow a hypnotic slave path, or <b>she flirts</b> for her to be a nymphomaniac and a slut/lover path. Choose <b>no idea</b> for no resolution and then pick in the next option</li>
				<li>call Sofia/Angelica if charmed or visit Sir Ronald or Sarah to ask to borrow a limo. Wait for the next Saturday night (do other things by all means) and visit Mom's room. She does out with Aunt Brandi and you tag along for a bit. Similar choices to above.</li>

			<h3 id="camryn">Charm Camryn</h3>
			<p>Estimated time: 3 days.</p>
			<p>Visit Hannah's apartment after 20:00. She is not there to greet you. Ask Monique where she is, then go to sleep or take care of some othe business.<br/>
			The following morning Hannah will call you and give you her sister's address. Meet her there and speak with her. Once you have the opportunity you can be generous or selfish: this will change some dialogues, but it doesn't seem to have lasting effects on Hannah or Camryn.<br/>
			Tell her about the Possession spell and pick up Camryn's pendant.</p>
			<p>Go to the Sacred Clearing and possess Camryn. Your main goal is to discover the most about the situation and to put Camryn in a safe place. Additionally you may want to see some sexy scene. The downside is that many actions you'll do will cost you time, and after 17 such actions Camryn is lost and you with her.<br/>
			Start by checking your surroundings, yourself and your thoughts. None of these cost time.<br/>
			Next you may want to masturbate (1 action). Every other action except eavesdropping on the conversation is useless and costs you time (actually trying to open the door doesn't, but it's still useless).<br/>
			Now eavesdrop on the conversation. There are many ways to progress the story here, some better than others. First listen some more, then start knocking on the door.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Cast Invisibility. (3 actions and 5 mana)</li>
				<li>Wait for the door to open and hypnotize the guy. (3 actions and 1 mana, available only if you don't masturbate)</li>
				<li>Wait for the door and seduce the guy. (4 actions if you exit quickly, 5 if you have sex with him)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this order, check for other rooms (1 action), check the table (no actions), then the vial (1 action) and the beer (1 action). Finally spike the beer (1 action).<br/>
			At 11 actions you'll trigger a new event, so if you have some free time you need to waste it. I suggest to check the papers (1 action), the laptop (1 action) and the papers (1 action) again. If you still have time, do something else, it doesn't matter what.</p>
			<p>Now you have severe limitations on time. Bring the beer to the second criminal (1 action), then examine him (1 action) and unlock the laptop (no actions). Check the emails (all three of them, 1 action each) and the private folders (1 action), but not the chronology, or you'll exceed the time limit. Close the laptop and head for the safe room.</p>
			<p>You can now end the possession, Camryn is in a safe place and you know where to find her.</p>
			<p>Go to the Police Station and tell Officer Batton about Camryn's whereabouts. Wait for news and proceed with the story, then Camryn returns to the Police Station. Ask details about the operation, then you have nothing more to do here.</p>
			<p>The following day Hannah informs you Camryn is at her home. You can either go directly there or let Hannah bring you to her, for a different charm scene. If you go there alone you can turn her into your lover or your slave.</p>
			<p>After you charmed Camryn, ask her about these guys and about Hannah.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice path-conspiracy">
				<p>The first time you visit Hannah she will offer to ride you everywhere in town, whenever you want. You have now a free taxi.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h3 id="lilith">Charm Lilith The Vampyre</h3>
			<p>Estimated time: 7 nights.</p>
			<p><b>To start this you must of at least done the Seance to summon Kurndorf's ghost and Legion is free</b>. It can wait any amount of time after this.</p>
			<p>You will need either Purified Garlic, Pamela's Bracelet or the Rosary to complete this charm. Also delay this until you have Bambi charmed and know where Kurndorf's crypt is.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice path-murder">
				<p>During the day visit the Gates Mansion.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="path path-conspiracy">
				<p>Wait for midnight and visit the Gates Mansion.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Talk to Sarah and ask her why does she keep looking out the window and then what is out there. Leave and either sleep the following night somewhere or at night go for a walk in the graveyard (sleep is probably best)</p>
			<p>You will see a woman in yellow (Lilith slightly disguised). You will be unable to leave. When she returns there are two options
			<ul>
				<li>approach her - leads to a bad ending as she feeds on you</li>
				<li>get the hell out of there - she does not persue you</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>Visit Sarah and talk about her.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice">
				<p>(Optional) Talk to Sir Ronald about vampires</p>
			</div>
			<p>Do something else for a few days until Sarah sends you an SMS, go to the mansion and choose "I'll protect you"</p>
			<p>You can give her the Book or not, depending on your choice the time needed and the scenes you'll see will change.</p>
			<p class="bold">NOTE: From now on the Sacred Clearing is a deadly place. Don't go there at night, you'll die.</p>
			<p>If you give her the Book, tell her not to worry and wait for darkness/protect Sarah, then follow the story. Sarah will charm the Vampyre for herself.</p>
			<p>If you don't, just follow the story.</p>
			<p>Whatever your choice was, let Sarah teach you <span class="italic">Mir Daru</span>, the Unlife Enspelled spell. As of version 14.8.4 this is the last spell you can learn.</p>
			<p>If you gave Sarah the Book, you'll have to wait for 2-3 nights, then Sarah will offer to give you the vampire. When asked, say you can bind the Vampyre, but you need to have Bambi charmed for this. Use the Silver Ring on her and immediately cast Unlife Enspelled. Avoid any distraction or it's game over.</p>
			<p>If you held the Book for yourself, teleport in the Wild Ranges and enter the Crypt. Immediately cast Unlife Enspelled. The Vampyre is now your servant.</p>
			<p>As soon as you enslave the Vampyre, Ms. Jones will send you an SMS, if she is your slave. Teleport into the school during the night, with the Vampyre following you. You can choose if you want to side with Ms. Jones or the Vampyre, but at the moment the choice has probably no consequences. As of version 14.8.4 this is the end of the Hellgate story arc.</p>
			<p>The Vampyre will follow you at night and can feed on your slaves. Feeding on Tina transforms her into a Dhampir, while feeding on any other slave has no effect as of version 14.8.4. Feeding on Jessica, if she is still bound, triggers a special scene, but nothing more. If Lilith feeds five times, it's game over. She consumes one feeding per night. You can dismiss the Vampyre at any time, but her presence is the only thing that can keep you alive when you visit the Sacred Clearing at night.</p>
			<p>Now it's a good moment to learn a new training, Medium Powers. This is the last important training, so from now on you can train the skill you prefer.</p>
			
			<h3 id="keana">Charm Keana</h3>
			<p>Estimated time: 4 nights or more.</p>

			Go upstairs and speak with Nurse Sandra in Ward 1 East about the ghost, she will follow you in the basement and alleviate the ghost's torment. Quickly cast Unlife Enspelled, or the ghost is gone forever.</p>
			<p>Come back the next night and commune with Keana to gain some mana. Return here the following night and commune again. If for some reason you cannot, just come back every night until you can commune.</p>
			<div class="path path-apprentice">

				<p>Go in front of the Gates Mansion and visit the Garage Area. Go to the entrance door and speak with her. Once there are no more options, try to charm her.</p>
				<p>Speak with Sarah Gates about her. She can't help you, so you have to resort to other forms of help.</p>
				<p>First visit the Town Hall. Ask Mayor Thomas about Sofia, then speak with Angela.<br/>
				Then go to the Police Station and discuss your plans on Sofia and listen to Kerry's last point.</p>
				<p>Sofia will leave at 8:00 and return at 10:00, so you have two hours to explore her house. Go there the next morning and cast Pass to enter the house.<br/>
				Once inside examine the coffee table, check the wooden door and look at the houseplants, then inspect the shiny object and pick up the brass key.<br/>
				Go upstairs, look under the bed, inspect the laptop, check out the wardrobe and use the brass key you found before.<br/>
				Finally cast Clairvoyance, enter the secret area and read the diary. Return to the bedroom and get out. It should take you less than one hour, so you have some margin for error.</p>
				<p>For the final step go to the Police Station and wait for Officer Batton to return with Sofia. Enter the interrogation room and charm her.</p>
				<p>Go to Sofia's house again and speak with her. From now on she is your driver, you can call her on the phone and she will bring you anywhere in town.</p>

			<p>There is different post charm content for the two paths, a bit more for the lover path.</p>
			
			<div class="path path-apprentice">
				<h3>Charm Lauren</h3>
				<p>Generally it is best to not do this! To do so the simplest way now is wait to visit Sarah in her room and do the diversions with Lauren like workout or go swimming. Each time cast the charm spell on her. Repeat until charmed!</p>
				<p><b>BUT</b> everytime you visit Sir Ronald after this he may discover it and end your apprenticeship and bar you from the Mansion forever. You can avoid by not visiting his study if wanted.</p>
			</div>

			<ul>
				<li>- break the lamp and charm her. <b>Only slave is possible here</b> as she is angry with you.</li>
				<li>- Do not break it, ask Geraldine where she lives and visit her at home (near the mansion). Can charm as slave or lover. as you wish.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3 id="jade">Charm Jade</h3>
			<p><b>Vampiric Goul</b></p>
			<p>Visit Jade with Lilith following. You will have to visit twice as you first need to talk to Jade about vampires in general. After visiting with Lilith talk to Lilith about Jade.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Visit Jade again and try to charm her, it will fail</li>
				<li>visit again the following night to see a laundry event and realise she works part time in the gym</li>
				<li>visit the gym between 6pm and 9pm and see Jade working there. Try to charm her again (shielded charm required), it works better but still fails</li>
				<li>Talk to Lilith and she will tell you she can take Jade as a ghoul</li>
				<li>visit the gym outside while Jade is working there. Talk to Lilith and choose the ambush option</li>
				<li>she is now a ghoul</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As a ghoul she can no longer manage the club, see below for the slave path, but talk to Lilith/Jade at the crypt to start arranging a replacement</p>
			
			<p><b>Charmed Slave, Charmed Equal or Uncharmed Equal</b></p>
			<p>Common to all three paths here, first take care of Legion. If you do not defeat Legion then only the slave option is available. Similarly you need the training manipulative charms for the others.</p>				
			<p>Visit a place of power like the Sacred Clearing or the Hidden Room if the Dragon Gem is moved there. Cast a spell, simplest is just cast Clairvoyance and you will see it is more powerful</p>
			<p>Once Legion is defeated follow the process to free Seraphina, but once you get possession <b>and before freeing her</b> do the following. If you free Seraphina without Jade or have already you can still charm Jade but only the slave option is available.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>talk to Jade and offer to show her the ritual of return</li>
				<li>Do the Ritual to free Seraphina in the Hidden Room OR pretend to at the Wild Ranges</li>
				<li>when you get the process preparing for the ritual call Jade to join you. She will arrive</li>
				<li>do the ritual. It can fail if you mess up the setup, if this happens you can only use the slave charm</li>
				<li>cast the charm spell before she leaves</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The slave charm proceeds now with no other requirements. You will tie Jade up in her room at the club and she will remain there.</p>
			<p>If you succeeded in freeing Sera you can also charm Jade as an equal, a charmed lover path</p>
			<p>If you suceeded and are carrying the silver ring you can free Jade from the spell and she will become an equal, a lover sort of path. Different options than the charmed lover case.</p>
			
			<p><b>Charmed Slave or Ghoul Manager</b></p>
			<p>As a slave or ghoul Jade cannot manage the club or be a dominatrix anymore. Visit the club next time it open for an event telling you this.</p>
			<p>Now visit Jade (and Lilith if a ghoul) and discuss this. Now visit one or more of</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mrs Robbins (charmed). She will work all week if the only one or otherwise Thurs-Fri</li>
				<li>Seraphina (charmed or free). She will work all week if the only, otherwise Mon-Wed or Sat-Wed depending</li>
				<li>Nella (charmed). She will work on the weekends</li>
				<li>Betty (charmed lover). She will work on the weekdays</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Only 3 are needed at most, you cannot assign more, their schedules will vary a little depending on the exact combinations.</p>

		<h2 onclick="hide('ch9')">Chapter 9: Ending The Game</h2>
		<div id="ch9" class="spoiler" style="display: none;">
         <p>Charm all police, including Gina and Diane, all people at Town Hall, including Emily (Tammy and Savanna are not needed). Also a few other key people like Tess, Mr Beasley. Defeat Davy, Legion and Kurndorf. You must also of met Miku.</p>
			<p>If Jessica is bound in the cellar, make sure to choose to keep her permanently or free her by bring Hannah to alter her bindings</p>
			<p>Return home to your bedroom and the end game should be offered.</p>
			<p>If you already refused to end the game, prior to charming Didi, you can talk to Tess on a Sunday night to see the final sequence of the game.</p>
			<p>A suggestion: save just before ending the game. The scene presented are chosen at random, so you'll probably see something different every time. You can choose to fully explore the ending and see all possible versions.</p>
			<p>If you have charmed Miss. Logan as a breeder and had sex with her as a male/futa then you will see end game pregnant scenes for many of those you have charmed. So far not all but a majority.</p>
