/****************************************************************
		Mom's Response Base

Introduction to Mother:

 Your mother is one of the most precious thing in your life, next to Tracy. They have always been the closest ones to you, not just because they’re family, but  they were always there for you and support you in anything. Mom is especially a real sweetheart, she even slapped a Mom on the face because she called you  "a weirdo who creeps out the other kids” at the playground years ago. You can’t really imagine what she would react if you would tell her that you can control other’s minds and emotions. One day you will have to do something about it, because you will rule this town and everyone in it and everyone will be your slave! Maybe that day isn’t really that far away? You do want to share the experience and joy with her, tough. You want her to relax and have fun after she’s  been working hard for 25 years, she deserves some rest. Maybe you could give her a couple of slaves to look after her needs, but first you have to make her believe what you are doing is right.
