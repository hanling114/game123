Kurndorf

Introduction to Kurndorf:

It’s the legend himself, the evil Kurndorf! Even in the afterlife he has not given up and is still hellbent on getting the whole world to serve him. His ghostly appearance is horrifying and magical at the same time. You have to beat this guy or else he will rule this town instead of you, and we all know it would terrible for all these women to be his slaves instead of yours, right? How can you outsmart one of the most powerful warlock in the world, though? You will always need to be on edge when dealing with this guy, who knows what he is capable of, even if he is just a ghost.
