/*
Introduction to Tina Robbins:
The bedroom is occupied by a brunette young girl. She must be Tina, the one Mrs. Robbins talked about. According to her, Tina is Davy’s sister. That means that she can posess some kind of magical knowledge just like his brother. It looks like the two didn’t really like each other because Tina is trapped in this room. She looks tired and exhausted and looks at you with weary eyes. Maybe she could be of use to you. You are sure she would be more than willing to help against his evil brother.
