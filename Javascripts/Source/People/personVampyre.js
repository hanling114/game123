// Vampyre
/*
The vampire is real! Sarah was right! The spawn of darkness is standing in front of you. You cannot make out a lot because of darkness and the fogginess, but you can clearly see those eyes. They are already compelling you! You wait a few seconds while your eyes get used to the darkness and you observe the beast better. It’s definitely a she! The vampire has great curves and. You also notice her pale skin and the pair of fangs hanging out of her mouth. The typical characteristic of a vampire.
You stand beside Sarah, mouth agape. You are terrified, but you have to do something. It’s your life at stake!

Basic description of the Vampire after you enslaved her ( phase one ):

You managed to save Sarah from this creature of the night, but now the vampire has been chained to you in many ways. She’s your slave, your servant both in mind and body. You have a vampire at your command! Your very own vampire! Could you have believed that a week ago? No one would either if you haven’t charmed them or show them with their own eyes.
The vampire is a reluctant and stubborn species as you realise by your very few and short conversations with her. They are very from what a person nowadays expect them to be. She doesn’t sparkle and is not a very friendly woman all together. Nothing like Edward from the Twillight series, instead she reminds you of Dracula from those old black and white movies. She rarely speaks, only if she has to, answering to your questions with a one or two words sentences mostly. She is always on the lookout for dangers, scanning the faces she meets.
Your vampire lady follows you everywhere during the night. She’s like a shadow, stays behind only a few steps away from you. When you stop, she stops too or if you run somewhere she runs with you never leaving your side for a second.
Sometimes when you roam the town at night you forget that she’s even there! Yep, she’s that silent and careful!But she’s always watching you like a lioness protecting it’s cub from danger.
Your vampire slave usually wear a robe around her neck and a hood to hide her face. A simple tunic made from fabric protects her slim and musculine body, but her boobs are sometimes wide open. She wears red and black which fits her persona "nicely”!
