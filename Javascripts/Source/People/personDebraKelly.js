/*
Introduction to Debra:

The dotted dressed girl is an exotic beauty for sure! She must have some asian blood in her, but you can’t really tell from that far, you have to come closer to her. You should strike up a conversation with her, who knows, maybe she is as sweet as her body! You can’t really recognise this lady that means she must be a newcomer. This could make friends with her a lot easier. She looks a bit lonely and numb, sitting all alone on a park bench. You can’t really leave a woman alone to  herself and feeling sad, you are a gentleman after all! Go ahead and talk to her, if nothing else, she could be a great "bedwarmer” for a night or two!

Introduction to Janet:

The house is right where Debby told you. A strange smell hit you as enter the front door, the smell of old and new mixed together. As Janet opens the door you now understand where the smell oridebrated from. The two sisters are still in the middle of the packing into the house process. There are boxes lying around, plastic drapes searating the rooms from each other and a lot of empty spaces waiting to be filled with furnitures. Janet looks a bit like Debra, but stands on her own as a pretty girl. She has some kind of sluttiness vibe around her which makes her interesting. She sports some simple clothes and her hair is bit messy from all the packing. You open your hand waiting for her to shake it. She seems very polite which contradicts those impressions you first felt about her.
