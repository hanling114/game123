There were even rumors that Kurndorf possessed a book that enabled him to turn even his most critical foes to his side. Though few people nowadays believe in magic, you do. Stories from your family abound with tales of magic and the occult. The scattered descriptions of the book have led you to believe it could be the <i>Sacred Book of Control</i> the grimoire that is said to contain all the secrets of manipulating and controlling the mind and even the body.</p>" +
