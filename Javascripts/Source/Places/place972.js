			'<p>Mr Beasley tears the book out of your hands in one swift motion and hastily begins to flip through the pages.</p>' +
			'<p>"Yes... I finally have it, this is indeed the legendary book of Control." Your teacher chuckles to himself. "And here is just what I need now! Dai Chu, ' + perYou.getPersonName() + '!"</p>' +
			'<p>A strange feeling rushes through your body the moment your teacher speaks these words, like an unusual warmth starting in your chest and quickly spreading through every part of you, and there is something... unsettling in the way his eyes linger on you.</p>' +
			'<p>Well, not really unsettling as much as arousing.</p>' +
			'<p>You don\'t know why, but you quickly find yourself leaning against one of the tables, rolling back your shoulders to flex your chest muscles and returning the... weirdly charming smile he graces you with.</p>' +
			'<p>You are not sure why you never noticed, but Mr Beasley is actually a fairly attractive man, and you are not even that much into men. He is tall, clearly works out and that bulge in his pants looks so very promising...</p>' +
			'<p>If he wouldn\'t be so arrogant and constantly creeping after girls much younger than him, he could be quite popular with women.</p>' +
			'<p>Well, and really, doesn\'t a stud like him deserve to be arrogant? And sharing his vast experience with younger women suddenly does seem like a noble thing to do, in fact, you really hope he is into younger men as well.</p>' +
			'<p>He is talking to you, but your mind is so occupied thinking of what it would be like to tear off that sweater that you barely notice it until he harshly addresses you.</p>' +
			'<p>"' + perYou.getPersonName() + '!"</p>' +
			'<p>You snap out of your daydream, and as you try to focus a part of you realizes that something is very wrong... why would you think these thoughts? Why suddenly desire another man? More-so, this man of all people?</p>' +
			'<p>“I will need you to be more attentive, if you are to be my apprentice, ' + perYou.getPersonName() + '” Mr Beasley sneers in annoyance, and every clear thought you just had is supplanted by the crushing realisation that you have disappointed him.</p>' +
			'<p>“I am sorry sir.” You quickly say. Maybe you can salvage this, you don\'t know why but there is absolutely nothing you want more than to be this mans apprentice, to earn his admiration. “I will do everything to make up for it.”</p>' +
			'<p>“That you will do.” Mr Beasley seems immensely pleased with himself, and you barely notice that you have begun to take off your clothes as he once again stops you.</p>' +
			'<p>“No! You will not serve me this way, ' + perYou.getPersonName() + '” Your heart breaks a little as you hear that, but your mind quickly adjusts to the new input and your disappointment subsides.</p>' +
			'<p>“You are friends with the Ross sisters are you not?”</p>' +
			'<p>“Yes... Yes, Sir!” You quickly nod.</p>' +
			'<p>“Good.” He smiles smugly, and you never noticed how handsome he looks when he does that. “Call them, arrange a meeting in a secluded part of the school and then do as I say. They will be the first to my harem.”</p>' +
			'<p>There is a brief moment of struggle inside you, and you have to admit that a part of you is uncomfortable with this order. He is talking about enslaving your friends, after all, but of course, a man like him deserves to have the best of women for himself... you shouldn\'t be selfish.</p>' +
			'<p>“Of course, sir! Oh! I\'m sure you remember my sister Tracy, shall I call her as well?” You take out your phone and watch your master expectantly in hopes that your initiative pleases him, and your heart skips a beat when he smiles and nods his head.</p>' +
			'<p>“Do that, in fact, let us talk about the rest of your Family, did you know that your cousin recently transferred to Glenvale Secondary?”</p>'

			'<p>"As I was saying,” He says with an annoyed sigh. “I am more than willing to take you in as my apprentice, but it appears that I will need to apply some discipline first. Undress!"</p>' +
			'<p>There is something incredibly compelling in his voice and you have already discarded most of your clothing before you realize what is happening.</p>' +
			'<p>"Wh...why am I doing this? What... are you doing with me...?" You ask weakly as he rises to his feet and takes off his glasses.</p>' +
			'<p>“This is for your own good, ' + perYou.getPersonName() + '.” You shudder as he speaks your name, and despite something deep within you screaming that what is happening is wrong, you do not resist as he bends you over his knee, exposes your rear and brings his ruler down on it.</p>' +
			'<p>“Ahh!” The sudden burst of pain catches you of guard, and it doesn\'t look as if he intents to give you a lot of time to recover.</p>' +
			'<p>“You are a bad girl,' + perYou.getPersonName() + '” the ruler comes down again on another spot, but just as hard.” Constantly under-performing and asking for extensions, but no more, understood?”</p>' +
			'<p>You try to answer, but only spout gibberish.  Tears well in your eyes as strike after strike lands on your poor ass, each hit bringing a sharp burst of pain, clouding your mind, making it harder to focus, to think...</p>' +
			'<p>When he finally stops, your backside tingles all over and your heart is racing. To your surprise, the sensation is rather... pleasant, and your thoughts are less focused on what he might be doing with your mind than what he could be doing with your aching, wet pussy.</p>' +
			'<p>“Yes, Mr. Beasley!” You whimper, and immediately receive another rough strike.</p>' +
			'<p>“You will address me as master, my apprentice!” He scolds you, any you feel ashamed for not doing so to begin with.</p>' +
			'<p>“Yes Master!”</p>' +
			'<p>“Good.” He stops for a moment and gently drives his fingertips over your reddened skin. “You will be the first to my Harem, ' + perYou.getPersonName() + ' you will be attentive and dedicated, and you will do whatever I tell you to do without hesitance, understood?”</p>' +
			'<p>Your mind absorbs every word without question, changing the very way you view the world to accommodate to his orders, everything is suddenly so clear, your goals, your purpose... to think you ever had doubts about this man!</p>' +
			'<p>“Yes, Master.” You acknowledge the order, and his fingers slide so close to your pussy... if he\'d just move them a tiny bit to the side they\'d...</p>' +
			'<p>“Good girl.” You groan in frustration as he pushes you off his lap onto the floor, but quickly move to kneel before him and try to ignore the burning need inside you, your eyes focus on his crotch and your heart quickens as he opens his pants.</p>' +
			'<p>“And now, my apprentice, you will learn how to service me.”'
